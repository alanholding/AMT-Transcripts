<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have the tremendous pleasure of talking to someone that, I've gotten to know over the years. It's been a, a slow but growing friendship. The most recent time we spent a little time in New York as part of a thing at Columbia. And, I got a chance to learn more about this incredible cat. His name's Tom Herb. I am sure a lot of people's ears just pricked up because he has got his fingers <span style="color:red" data-ts="39.925" data-end_ts="40.245" title="39.925" id=c_"39.925">__entered__</span> practically everything. And so that means this podcast we get to talk about everything we 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom Erbe: </b><laugh>. Thank you. Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Nice to be here. Yeah. On the Skype connection. Yeah, indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me. Let's start off by talking a little bit or kind of covering a little bit about what your current activities are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Okay. Well, I'm a professor at University of California San Diego, and I teach a lot of classes about computer music. This quarter I'm teaching a class on programming embedded processors, so we're getting into the real low level stuff. But yeah, I have, oh, we have about 70 students in our ICAM program, which is, arts and technology program at UCSD. And, we bring 'em along different paths, but now I have the little core that's, doing, you know, programming and really wanting to build their own stuff. Sure. That's present. I'm doing other things, but, we'll, we'll get to those. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, one of the things that I know a lot of my listeners will be well aware of is the work that you did starting many years ago on a variety of, algorithms that you gave the label of sound hack. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, I remember the first time I stumbled on those, I was, I think it was the first time I used it was on my Mac eight 40 AV or something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b><laugh>. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. And it was stunning because all of a sudden I could do pitch, pitch shifting and time stretching and, and kind of, it was my first experience of really playing with, with sound in sort of an elastic way. It was really pretty, pretty interesting. And what's been interesting is to kind of watch those algorithms grow over the years and become parts of different things. Right. So let's start off, first of all with the idea, the sound hack idea. Where did it come from? Where did you get, how did you get kind of pushed into doing that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>It was, my, my first job after school was as a research assistant at UCSD. And, that lasted for about three years. I worked with people like Max Matthews and Dick Moore and Mark Dolson, all these great researchers. But eventually I wanted to be somewhere with a little more musical action and, went up to Mills College and became the technical director there. And what I found was a place, in contrast to UCSD, <span style="color:red" data-ts="194.965" data-end_ts="195.165" title="194.965" id=c_"194.965">__it__</span> was a place where really exciting, but we had no budget at all. And what I wanted to do was bring some of those sounds that, you know, some of the processes we were working on <span style="color:red" data-ts="206.585" data-end_ts="206.805" title="206.585" id=c_"206.585">__are__</span> really, a lot of these were Mark Olson's ideas and turn them into things that the musician with just a Mac could do, could use. And so, I mean, I was particularly interested in, sound file, convolution, cross synthesis, the phase, <span style="color:red" data-ts="222.245" data-end_ts="222.485" title="222.245" id=c_"222.245">__well__</span>, coder time stretching that, infinite time stretching that I hadn't heard anywhere, but on mainframes at that point. And I thought, boy, this would be really special to bring this into, you know, the tape studio or just anyone's studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I remember the first time that I, that I grabbed the file, I put in there and then, you know, went to sleep. And when I woke up the next morning, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I had something that I had never heard before. It was amazing. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>You can imagine how this might be to debug these algorithms, you know? My <span style="color:red" data-ts="253.005" data-end_ts="253.085" title="253.005" id=c_"253.005">__gosh__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, right, exactly. One day turnaround on a test. Right. Yeah. <laugh>. Unreal. So, as, as I recall, and as you mentioned, there were actually a lot of different things that you were, that, that sound hack sort of embraced. What, who was it that you said a lot of these concepts branched from? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, mark Dolson implemented a lot of these ideas. I mean, most of these ideas have been around for a long, long time and have their own history. And, and of course, as most ideas pass through many, many hands <laugh>, you know, as they get formed. But Mark Dolson built a few of these tools for the computer Audio Research lab, toolkit, which was something that UCSD put out, and that went out on, nine track meg tape to, different research centers. And you basically had to own a million dollar computer to run them. Right. So part of it was I really wanted to get these things out there where anyone could use them, and I mean, anyone who could afford a computer, and even <span style="color:red" data-ts="314.365" data-end_ts="314.645" title="314.365" id=c_"314.365">__then__</span> computers were a little bit expensive, but it, it was a huge change. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. So how primitive were the tools and how difficult was it to take things that were meant to run <span style="color:red" data-ts="327.805" data-end_ts="327.965" title="327.805" id=c_"327.805">__on__</span> a mainframe and get 'em to even operate? I mean, was there, did you have to do like language translations or was it really like you learn the concept on one machine and kind of start from scratch on the other? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, I mean, a lot of things that people take for granted now, like having libraries that allow you to, you know, read and write sound files or to do FFTs or to do filters, all of these things had to be built by scratch. I mean, there were FFT algorithms, but the ones that Mark Dolson was using were made in fortran. And so I had to write my own. And, you know, of course using textbooks and other guides, you know, in, in c and I had to write. And then for sound file formats, a lot of this was just very sketchily documented. Some was very well documented. The A <span style="color:red" data-ts="374.845" data-end_ts="375.525" title="374.845" id=c_"374.845">__IFF__</span> was, and I just, you know, I just had to write the code. That was sort of the attitude at Mills College was, if you wanna do something, just write the code, you know, do it tonight. And, I definitely got that attitude there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, one of the things I also though, remember, is that I think my first copy of Sound hack was, I think, yeah, I think I'd always downloaded it, right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it was one of the first pieces of software for which downloading was actually an integral part of interacting with it. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. Yeah. You know, you can get it from your Gopher server or Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Exactly. <laugh>, but <laugh>, it's, why did you decide to do that? Why did you decide not to pursue it as sort of like a commercial thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, I was really focusing on algorithms that I was pretty sure the commercial industry had no interest in at the point. I mean, these were things that Yes. Took overnight, and, it was not the common musician who would want to run a program overnight to get a new sound. So, I mean, I did talk to people, like, I remember talking to <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.585" data-end_ts="447.805" title="447.585" id=c_"447.585">__Stu__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.905" data-end_ts="448.125" title="447.905" id=c_"447.905">__at__</span> Tech and they were definitely not interested and, you know, but, but on the other hand, I also, my initial interests in music were in sort of the underground community. And I used to read magazines like Op, remember that magazine? Yes, absolutely. And everyone, everyone with a record would be running a tiny little ad in op. And, those were the things that got reviewed. And this was all underground, all sort of bulletin board stuff. And I thought, this is my community. This is how I wanna approach software where I'm just, you know, independent guy putting a little ad up and, check my stuff out. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Awesome. That, that was awesome story. So now, subsequent, or in subsequent years, you have made, pardon me if I'm wrong, and tell me if I'm wrong about this, but it seems like, it seems like the sound hack set sort of went dormant for some period of time, and then not now. What was happening prior to you making the plugins? Oh, yeah. Was it still floating around or, or did you just kind of like, put it on the shelf and not sweat it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, I, it got kind of big <laugh> and, and I, I just got tired of making it larger and larger. This was around 98, 99. Right. And, you know, and then we had to change, you know, convert everything over to Power PC and then convert everything over to OSS 10, and there was all this sort of like, like busy work, just keeping the thing the same. And suddenly I felt like, oh, this is a business and I'm not really enjoying it. And then it seemed like Macs were gonna go away for, for a moment. So I spent a good three years trying to build things in Java, and that just, sort of fell apart. Java wasn't really ready for big programs at that point. Right. Maybe, maybe now. But, so there was a little bit of failed experiments, but then I decided, hey, well maybe I can put some of these ideas into plugins, and this would allow me to do just a little thing at a time, finish the project and, move on to the next. And so it allowed me to sort of compartmentalize all my work, and I could get really into something and then, then forget it. And, so around, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="583.425" data-end_ts="583.645" title="583.425" id=c_"583.425">__now__</span>, I don't know what year, but around 2000 I started making plugins, starting with Decimate and a few others. Yeah. It, it was fun <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. One of the nice things about plugins is that it kind of shields you from like the operating system hellhole. And believe me, you know, like it's cycling, we're constantly crying. Every time Apple has any kind of announcement, we're just like, kind of cover our eyes and hope that it's not yet another breaking operating system update. Right. But, you know, in a way, plugins sort of shield you from the operating system, but not always. There's still plenty of ways that Apple or others can mess with you. Do you find that it's easier or the same pain? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, there's, there's definitely pain. There's ways of, you know, I mean, you definitely have to reinvent your plugins every so often just to keep up to date. And like right now, I'm, starting to use juice. And this is a plugin building platform that allows me to write the same, you know, five plugins with one bit of code, by saying five plugins. I mean, Macintosh, VST, Macintosh Audio Unit, Macintosh, A A X Windows A a X, and Windows VST. So now I have about 18 plugins, so 18 times five, this is how many pieces of software I'm supporting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="667.005" data-end_ts="667.205" title="667.005" id=c_"667.005">__Ah__</span>, that's insane. And, you know, I'm doing this by myself as my night and weekend time job, <laugh>. So you got to really concentrate on that. But I should say I'm still motivated to do plugins. Yes, it is a bit of work. But what I've always wanted to do is make something exciting that you can put into a, a daw. When I worked in analog studios, you'd always have these strange pieces of equipment that had their own peculiar character. You'd have reverbs that you could get ghost decos out of. You'd have delay lines that you could modulate, and that would distort in certain ways. And so this has always been the character of my plugin design, is to make something that has its own character and is not linear by any means. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Yeah. And I remember when we were in Columbia, we were there at a discussion round table kind of thing about production techniques, and I was, I was very interested in your talk because you talked in, you talked about things like that and sort of about embracing the, the ghostly in the studio, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, I, I find that really interesting because I've long had a, had a problem with people who focus on high quality studio gear, because I feel like that isn't necessarily, those aren't necessarily always the tools that have magic in them. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, sometimes the magic isn't found, found in some really crusty stuff that just happens to have its own peculiarities. You know, you know, now what we're seeing is a move towards a lot of peculiar systems, and one of those, one of those certainly is modular systems. And there again, Tom Herb has his fingers in the, swirling his finger around in the, in the stew of yet another sonic world. You are, have teamed up with make noise to produce some of the most outrageous modules that are out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Thanks. Yeah, no, that was, that was lucky. I mean, I'm, I've definitely <span style="color:red" data-ts="804.765" data-end_ts="805.125" title="804.765" id=c_"804.765">__enjoyed__</span> doing this sun where we're, we've worked on, I think four modules now, and we're gonna keep going. So yeah, it's, modular is the one instrument that you really can't control. The one electronic instrument, all acoustic instruments you can't control, but <laugh>, yeah. This is the one that you have to practice, you have to play with a lot before you get any good at it. And it's, that, I think, is where the magic is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I really appreciate you saying that because I think not enough people think of it in those terms, but the idea of practicing the instrument is very real in the modular world, because the way that modules interact with each other is very idiosyncratic, and you have to learn sort of the, you know, sort of the kneecaps and elbows of your system before you're gonna be effective with it at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's, it's hard because there is also the motivation to keep changing your own modular system. So learning an instrument that you're also constantly rebuilding becomes, you know, becomes a bit of a challenge. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. So let's talk a little bit about the, about the modules that you developed, because, some of them really are groundbreaking and some of them have a real, a real callback to some historically important gear as well. So like, the first, well, which would you like to talk about 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b><laugh>? I'll talk about the Echo <span style="color:red" data-ts="894.285" data-end_ts="894.485" title="894.285" id=c_"894.285">__phone__</span>. That's the first one. Okay. I mean, Tony and I met each other at a NAMM show, I think. And I always love going to the NAMM Show and going from booth to booth and just checking out everything that everyone's doing. And it, for me, it's an idea. Fair. You know, I'm, and maybe I'm gonna buy something, but mainly I <span style="color:red" data-ts="910.485" data-end_ts="910.645" title="910.485" id=c_"910.485">__want__</span> to talk to the engineers and find out what they're doing. You know, what secrets are you hooking up? And, try to pry it out of them. And then just start, you know, and then talk gear, talk algorithms and all that. And so Tony and I had a real good talk. He, was putting out the Phono <span style="color:red" data-ts="927.485" data-end_ts="927.605" title="927.485" id=c_"927.485">__gene__</span> at that time, and of course, the, the, the name attracted me. And, the look of the instruments attracted me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And, so we started talking about samplers and granular stuff and all that. And I told him to check out my plugins. And to my surprise, he did <laugh>. And he really liked what he heard. <span style="color:red" data-ts="948.265" data-end_ts="948.485" title="948.265" id=c_"948.265">__He__</span>, he, I, I think he recognized a common aesthetic going on. And, and this is one thing we've discovered is that I can build things and Tony likes, you know, we, we sort of like each other's ideas. So with Echo <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.245" data-end_ts="962.445" title="962.245" id=c_"962.245">__phone__</span>, this was my first project, he asked me to use this, hardware called the DSP Pick. This is a, a signal processing ship. It's, you know, it's, a little bit inexpensive, but, it's easy to program and, it does have one problem, and that is, it's a 16 bit register, so there's not a lot of resolution. And, I started programming it in Assembly Code because I wanted to it to be as fast as possible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And, I found that it had a, a character that really lent itself to, being a little raw and a little noisy. So this is the direction I went in the project. I better back up a bit. What I, what I felt was missing in modulars, to me, a modular's a sort of beast of the sixties and seventies and a thing you find in tape music studios. And the one thing that was missing in the current, you know, the revival modulars, was the tape deck. So I thought of all those tricks you could do with a tape deck, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1030.555" data-end_ts="1030.845" title="1030.555" id=c_"1030.555">__vary__</span> speed and, you know, echoes and tape loops. And this is what I was drawn to as my first project, because I thought this would be an excellent thing to add to a modular <laugh>. And so I, I started writing a delay line, and this became the ePhone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>But as I was doing it, I thought, well, why don't we do that old pitch shifting technique that the old, tempo <span style="color:red" data-ts="1055.565" data-end_ts="1055.725" title="1055.565" id=c_"1055.565">__phone__</span> used to do, which was a, a little box you'd stick on the side of your tape deck, had a rotary tape head, actually four tape heads that rotated and could go, an opposing speed to the tape, or it could go faster than the tape and it could do pitch shifts, by having these rotating heads. So this is what I implemented in the ePhone, and to very similar fidelity to the original, tempo <span style="color:red" data-ts="1082.885" data-end_ts="1083.045" title="1082.885" id=c_"1082.885">__phone__</span>. And so I made this little hybrid instrument that's a delay line. It, it distorts like crazy. If you want it to, you can turn it up past a hundred percent feedback actually goes to 150% with cascades of distortion after that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>The delay line or the pitch shifting is relatively good fidelity for one octave on either side, but it goes two octaves on either side, and that second octave is really quite, out of this world. So people really appreciated this, which, you know, I guess I wasn't that surprised. It was really crazy sounding module. And, Tony had the wisdom to take the two main parameters and put 'em on big knobs, and so when people perform with it, they can really take those knobs and, you know, play with it live. Right. So that, that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1138.235" data-end_ts="1138.525" title="1138.235" id=c_"1138.235">__Koon__</span>. We did a lot to try to, make it a part of the system. I mean, for me, the modular is really special because it's a collection of different objects and these objects, it's really up to the musician, the performer, to put them together and to have 'em interact with each other. And it's not like there's no, well, I never wanna make a sort of canned synthesizer as a module. It's, there's never an island in modular <laugh>. So we did a lot to have it respond to clocks and control voltages and, you know, one volt perve on the pitch shifting and all that. So yeah, that's, it was successful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. And, and it's just interesting that, well, it's, it's interesting to me that, that you, your discussion about it was one of, was one of the first times that people really seemed to be doing interesting new develops development with quirks. Prior to the ePhone, I felt like everything was either trying to be high quality or was trying to emulate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1210.105" data-end_ts="1210.525" title="1210.105" id=c_"1210.105">__buchla__</span> quirks, right? Yeah, yeah. <laugh> and that, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1213.005" data-end_ts="1213.125" title="1213.005" id=c_"1213.005">__then__</span> it was one of those two avenues. And so the reason that, I guess maybe the phene was sort of like this too, but the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1221.395" data-end_ts="1221.685" title="1221.395" id=c_"1221.395">__fund__</span> especially was one of those things where like, like you said, having the feedback go to 150% or, or allowing the pitch shift to go beyond where it sounds good to the point where it sounds like interesting and its own thing that's sort of embracing what has now become maybe a little more common in the, in the modular world. But at the time didn't seem to be, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1247.085" data-end_ts="1247.205" title="1247.085" id=c_"1247.085">__I__</span> mean, yeah, I mean, it's really, I'm, I'm reacting against, you know, clean synthesis sounds, and I, I always like to push it further and, you know, the biggest frustration to me is to have everything under a little, a couple membrane switches and a little, view screen and where I can't program anything. You know, <laugh>, I, I remember the most fun I had with a certain synthesizer of the eighties was when I found I could just, send random system exclusive into it, and it suddenly started making interesting sounds <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, after the, what was the module you did after the Epiphone then? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Oh, after that I rewrote the phono <span style="color:red" data-ts="1291.405" data-end_ts="1291.645" title="1291.405" id=c_"1291.405">__gene__</span>. So not really a module, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, so you were, you were the person that did that firmware update? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, I did a rev. I didn't realize that. Oh, okay. So this is really interesting to modular people <laugh>, but it wasn't, basically, I got rid of a lot of aliasing noise that was in there, and I tuned it a little so that the knob ranges are a little more intelligent. And so, but we kept it pretty much the same and tried to preserve all the noisy things that happened, including, I made an accidental, infinite record mode, a feature <laugh>. So it used to be you had to do like, you know, various recipes of button clicks to get into this weird mode, which was an accident, and everyone loved it. And so I, I changed it, so you just had to hold on the record button for a little while <span style="color:red" data-ts="1338.585" data-end_ts="1338.805" title="1338.585" id=c_"1338.585">__and__</span> got into, but yeah, I, I did that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1340.985" data-end_ts="1341.205" title="1340.985" id=c_"1340.985">__and__</span> I felt we were, Tony and I were a bit mixed feeling about it because it took just as much development as a new module.

<b>Tom: </b>Right. And it was really just the old module. And, you know, we sort of felt, oh, maybe next time we'll just, you know, we do something like this. We'll just make something totally brand new. Right. Takes just as much time. Right. So a little lesson learned, because I think everyone would've been happy with their rev one, phono Genes. Well, I don't, I'm not gonna start any arguments about that. But after that, I started on the herb verb, which, was my reverb. This, this one, I did a lot of research in reverb. Most reverb was long <span style="color:red" data-ts="1380.445" data-end_ts="1380.565" title="1380.445" id=c_"1380.445">__a__</span> sort of hidden art, and now there's many more publications out about it, or definitely at the time I was researching it. And so I just, did what any research would do a literature search, start implementing the algorithms, starting to studying the algorithms. And I built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> code to emulate every reverb I read about. So I made a series of, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> patches, and I've made 'em into max patches now too <laugh>. So Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1408.725" data-end_ts="1408.965" title="1408.725" id=c_"1408.725">__people__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1409.325" data-end_ts="1409.445" title="1409.325" id=c_"1409.325">__I__</span>, they're all, they're on my website somewhere. Okay. And I learned a lot about reverb. And so I then took all the ideas I found special and sort of jammed them all together and then started mixing. And then once I got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> patch that I couldn't stop playing with, then I thought, okay, we're, we're, we're here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's golden right in, in your mind, what are the things that make a reverb algorithm cool? What, what are the things that suck you in? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, what I wanted again, was like that weird thing that happens, like, you know, you might be fascinated with something like an oil can delay, and it's because some weird sound that doesn't sound like an echo. It sounds peculiar. It's sort of mushy, and it doesn't, it's not exactly the same sound you put in. So this is what I wanted outta reverb. I wanted a room, but I wanted a, you know, I want, I want sustain after my voice or sustain after my note. But I want that sustained to be something different, you know, something, a room that has an unusual character that I can't, you know, that, that you haven't heard before, but I still want it to do the same thing to sort of give you more sustained to, to fill in after your note. So this is what I was looking for. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And yes, I was listening to things like the ghost voices that come out of the Ursa major space station. Hmm. Listening to the cosine and the lexicon reverbs, you know, various things like this, the infinite reverb that you'd get out of any sort of loop reverb algorithm, whether it's, Miller pockets, reverb or the lexicon reverbs, all of these special sounds. And I just wanted to mix 'em up, and I wanted to put control voltage on everything so that you could switch the size in a millisecond, you know, you could, and that you wouldn't just click to a new size, that you would be changing the size continuously. So, you know, you can get these incredible booms out of my reverb just by modulating the size parameter, with a, with a ramp wave. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I've always, I always wondered how you did that, because it seems like changing the size algorithm normally normally requires sort of a reset of the reverb. And so you, it's not something that's typically continuously variable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, it's, a reverb's built with a number of delay lines and a number of separate ones, and also some multi-tap delay lines, and then some special little delays, which are known as all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1564.205" data-end_ts="1564.445" title="1564.205" id=c_"1564.205">__pass__</span> filters. And what I decided to do, and there's also separate multiple types for early reflections. And what I decided to do was have this one knob reach in and modulate all maybe 20 delay times at the same time. Not all by the same amount, but, by different gradations depending on what I'm modulating. So as we go from a big Hal to a small hall, the early reflections change in a certain way. The, overall delay time changes in a certain way. Yeah. So it's just a matter of modulating a lot of things. And I think most people wouldn't choose to do this typically in a reverb, because it does take a bit of processing just to handle all the modulation. And in fact, I think in my design, the modulation takes as much CPU as the reverb itself, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1614.785" data-end_ts="1615.005" title="1614.785" id=c_"1614.785">__you__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See algorithm itself. Sure. That makes a lot of sense. It's very interesting. In order to really get a sense of all these reverbs, you kind of had to have access to all these reverbs. Where did you get, where'd you get your hands on the various things that you emulated? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, I've worked in recording studios since the seventies, so I've accumulated equipment and, when we decide that we no longer need the lexicon, PCM 70, it goes into my closet, <laugh> and, <laugh>. And if I need a, and of course, I keep all my plugins. I have, I borrowed a Ursa major from a friend, you know, I still have spring reverbs. All these things are just sort of hanging around. And then I bought a few re <span style="color:red" data-ts="1662.485" data-end_ts="1662.845" title="1662.485" id=c_"1662.485">__current__</span> reverbs just to make sure I wasn't being too old fashioned, you know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1667.205" data-end_ts="1667.405" title="1667.205" id=c_"1667.205">__Right__</span>. I wanted to make sure my fidelity was up to snuff. So for me, it was a little bit of a, a competition with all the gear that's out there, <laugh>, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1676.685" data-end_ts="1676.805" title="1676.685" id=c_"1676.685">__I__</span>, I will gladly trade closets with you because my closet has like old tennis rackets, <laugh> and, and boots that don't fit anymore. So if you ever <span style="color:red" data-ts="1686.975" data-end_ts="1687.325" title="1686.975" id=c_"1686.975">__wanna__</span> swap, just let me know. So that's, that's really interesting. Now, you also were involved in the ermo? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, I wrote, I did the pro 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Pronunciation of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. This is the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1698.565" data-end_ts="1698.765" title="1698.565" id=c_"1698.565">__Tale__</span> Harmonic and, a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Onic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. This initially, I mean, our initial idea was to make a combo organ, <laugh>. We were both thinking about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1706.235" data-end_ts="1706.525" title="1706.235" id=c_"1706.235">__Lisa__</span> and Continental organs, and it just, I mean, you know, but we gotta explore these ideas. We're listening to like Philip Glass and going, oh, yeah, I wish we could have this organ in a modular, <laugh>. I took that ideal ways. And basically I wrote code to give me an additive synthesizer so I could implement an organs, and I needed it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1727.925" data-end_ts="1728.005" title="1727.925" id=c_"1727.925">__to__</span> 32 harmonics, and I needed three notes at once, so I really needed, you know, three times 32 harmonics, you know, so I, I basically built a structure that gave me a pretty big analog synthesizer on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1741.325" data-end_ts="1741.445" title="1741.325" id=c_"1741.325">__a__</span> embedded processor. And then once we got there, I realized, well, yeah, the organ sounds just like that, and, maybe it should be something more flexible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And at the same time, we always have this idea that will make stuff inexpensive. It never ends up that entirely that way, but we try real hard. Right. And one of the ways <span style="color:red" data-ts="1762.685" data-end_ts="1762.885" title="1762.685" id=c_"1762.685">__of__</span> keeping things inexpensive is keeping the number of knobs low. You, if you add a knob, you add a knob, you add a jack for the, voltage control, and then you add another knob for modulation amount, and it just stacks up. So, so we wanted to keep it down to like five knobs, and, two of those would be relegated to tamr. I had to make some sort of synthesis algorithm with additive synthesis that just used two knobs for tamr. And so my idea was to have the flatness of the spectrum be one, one parameter where if it is very flat, then all the harmonics are the same volume, and as it goes to less flat, then the central, a central harmonic starts peaking out more and more until it's the only harmonic. And then the second knob became the central harmonic. So we call that the oid, which isn't entirely accurate, but it, it's sort of the, the way we did this additive thing. And it basically turned out like no other synthesis module. But yes, I was inspired by lots of additive stuff. I read up on everyone's additive synthesis, you know, project from the Hammond organ to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1837.925" data-end_ts="1838.125" title="1837.925" id=c_"1837.925">__Tell__</span> harmonium to, Les 360, and, you know, and, and the Hal <span style="color:red" data-ts="1843.365" data-end_ts="1843.605" title="1843.365" id=c_"1843.365">__Alice__</span> box, of course. Right. And, tried to pull a little bit from everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you are a recording guy from way back, you're a algorithm guy from that was a research assistant turned plugin maker. You embedded synth guy. Where the hell did all this stuff come from? I mean, what kind of mushrooms did you eat as a youngster to turn you into what you've become? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, well, you know, I came from Wisconsin, so this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1873.705" data-end_ts="1873.925" title="1873.705" id=c_"1873.705">__Hey__</span>, Wisconsin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b><laugh>. So part of the, the Milwaukee Music, MAFIAA <laugh>, not really <laugh>. I mean, I, I moved outta Wisconsin when I was 16, but, as I grew up, I was, you know, I was like, you know, the unathletic nerdy guy, you know, and, to me the thrill was the Radio Shack 101 project kit, or, I mean, when I was very young, my real big thrill was just to get a transistor radio. And then as soon as I had a transistor radio in, I think 1967, I had the transistor radio open, and I was, you know, playing around with the back and seeing what kind of noises you got out of it when you pressed these coils. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and then very soon you had a non-working transistor radio. There's always that part of the story, too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, if you, if you're as old as I am, you knew that transistor radios only lasted for three hours because the batteries back then just wore out completely. And your parents were like, oh, you need another battery? No, that's not gonna happen. Right. So, so you enjoyed a few hit songs, you know, and that was that <laugh>. But yeah, I was fascinated by electronics. And I have radio engineers in my family, and I had great uncle who, worked at WCFL, who very kindly gave me an oscilloscope when I was young and a microphone. And from there I spent hours just, you know, watching my voice on the oscilloscope and playing around with things. And then I started taking apart electronics. So I took apart my parents' TV set, and I took apart my parents', car radio <laugh>, which never worked again. And then eventually my dad thought, okay, let's take Tom to the TV repair place, and we'll give <span style="color:red" data-ts="1976.925" data-end_ts="1977.045" title="1976.925" id=c_"1976.925">__him__</span> things too that he can take apart that are already broken. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1980.605" data-end_ts="1980.845" title="1980.605" id=c_"1980.605">__with__</span>, so I had a, a sort of a bunch of TV carcasses that I played with. And so this was just like, you know, I was like nine, 10 years old just playing with stuff and being a geek at the same time. Yes, I got a short wave radio, and, I was very inspired by all those peculiar sounds that came over the short wave radio, those loud hums, those beeps, all those sort of mechanical stations, which I think are doing telemetry. But I had no idea at the time. So I started getting this relation with electronic sounds, and of course, the, the music that's stuck out to me in those days were the early electronic pieces, electronic pop pieces. Like I remember hearing Telstar, early on, just being blown away as a kid. I remember hearing, the Pink Floyd song, see Emily played, when it was, it was sort of a hit on AM radio for a while, and they had that sped up, interlude in the middle, and I was, you know, fascinated with sped up tape now. And then of course, the Beatles made everything popular with Revolution nine and, you know, these types of songs. So it was sort of typical upbringing of a nerd, music obsessed nerd. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A lot of people that, that make the, that end up approaching computer music, also have like this real heavy, are heavily steeped in some sort of instrumental practice. Did you do that? Were you like in school band and that kind of stuff, or? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I, I was in school band, but I wasn't very good. I, I mean, I didn't focus on it that much. I was in church choir a lot, and I did a lot of that, and I did a lot of singing and, you know, still do, you know, so that was a lot of my experience. Yeah, not, not so much. I was really focused on the electronics. And I'd say my real formative <span style="color:red" data-ts="2092.285" data-end_ts="2092.365" title="2092.285" id=c_"2092.285">__elect__</span>, music experience was in high school where we had a, high school radio station. Now, this was in, suburb of Chicago, station called WGHS. And back then they, high schools had radio stations, and as soon as they found out I could solder, I became the technical director. I <laugh>, you know, so, and had my radio show and, and we started competing with my friends, finding, you know, finding the best vinyl basically. So I was, I was sort of on a path to weirder and weirder stuff. And this was in the, in the mid seventies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. What did you end up going to study in college? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I went to, university of Illinois and studied electrical engineering at, at first and then switched to computer science when I felt that this was really where things were happening. Also had a, concentration in music, so I took as many music courses as I could. And at that point, joined, joined a little sort of electronic punk band in, in Urbana and, joined radio stations and just sort of really got into electronic music. So then I was playing a sequential Circuits Pro one and, Cassio Vone, where those were my main instruments. Nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Great combo. So one of the things I would say is that you, you hold a po kind of a position that most people can't, which is that you're very comfortable with code and you're very comfortable with electrons <laugh>. Yeah, yeah. You know, and a lot of people that are good with code have at best the hacker's relationship with hardware. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And a lot of people that are hardware hackers or are good at working with hardware tend to be pretty hack dalicious in their coding. How is it that you are kind of have strengths in both? I mean, it sounds like you have background in both, but at some point, normally people say, well, I prefer X over Y. You are sort of like an X and Y guy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. I don't know what I prefer, but, I, it's not really about that. It's about what I'm going to do and doing something that's interesting. And I love it when the thing is complete and built and it's wonderful, you know, so that's, that's always the thing I'm looking forward to. But I, I, I'd have to say that I got in this position by just being very driven. You know, you, back in 1979, they were not teaching computer music at the University of Illinois. They were teaching me how to build antenna arrays, you know, they're, you know, they were teaching nuts and bolts, electronics engineering, and I was learning how to use punch cards to program a computer. None of those skills translated, I mean, I basically had to learn all the things myself. And so I was just never afraid to pick up the books, find the books, find the articles, and copy people if I need to. And then after I'm done copying them, just making my own spin on things and finally, you know, getting enough skills so that I could just build it from scratch. I've, I'm really driven and I'm not afraid of learning, so, right. I'm not afraid of failing either <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Right. So what's interesting to me is kind of the timeframe that you went through all this stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2300.905" data-end_ts="2301.125" title="2300.905" id=c_"2300.905">__So__</span> you and I are virtually the same age. I remember one of the biggest difficulties for me was actually finding information that was useful in any way. Now, I think you spent more time around university environments you had access to, to stuff, but I mean, it's, it's hard now when if you have a coating problem, you can get on a stack overflow, or if you have a hardware problem, there's a bunch of forms where you can just say, Hey, what's the story with this, you know, with the voltage leg on this chip? And someone <span style="color:red" data-ts="2332.685" data-end_ts="2332.925" title="2332.685" id=c_"2332.685">__would__</span> be like, ah, the, the spec is wrong. Right? Yeah. Yeah. It used to be back in the day when the spec was wrong, what you ended up with is a whole bunch of magic smoke left the, left the ics, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, you'd have to learn the hard way, all this stuff, or you would have to track down obscure documents that were rarely published. And the turnaround time on publishing was terrible. It seems like the amount of data you would've had to accumulate to do some of the things you did would've been practically a full-time job. What was the thing that helped you gather up the kind of information that you needed to do the things that you did? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. I mean, there was a way of doing things in the eighties, and, you would go to, each semiconductor manufacturer would've a representative, and you'd drive over there and you'd just get data books. So there'd always be a day when us nerds would run out and just pick up tons and tons of data books, which would show us how all the chips worked. As far as programming, you'd, you'd pick up code that was working, you'd look at, the C Music source code, or you look at something Paul Lansky wrote, or you'd say, oh, I wanna do LPC. So you'd, you'd sit down with Paul <span style="color:red" data-ts="2410.085" data-end_ts="2410.285" title="2410.085" id=c_"2410.085">__de__</span> Marinas and say, Hey, how did you do the LPC <laugh>? And, he'd say, oh, I did this stuff based on speaking <span style="color:red" data-ts="2416.255" data-end_ts="2416.605" title="2416.255" id=c_"2416.255">__style__</span>, and then you get in this great talk. And so it was a real social sort of thing, but it was also, you'd have to reach out a lot to different manufacturers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2424.885" data-end_ts="2425.085" title="2424.885" id=c_"2424.885">__other__</span> thing, well, you can still do this, you can call and say, I want to get a sample chip to try this out and send me some data sheets. And that's how you deal with electronics, basically. But I was in some very special places when I worked at UCSD, my first, research assistant job was assisting Max Matthews and building an electronic violin. So, I mean, I was, you know, I am, I am made by my experiences. I'm here because Max Matthews put a lot into me, and Mark Dolson was building a Phase <span style="color:red" data-ts="2456.925" data-end_ts="2457.045" title="2456.925" id=c_"2456.925">__V__</span> coder, and he explained a lot to me. And, you know, all my teachers are really, responsible for, giving me this knowledge. Similarly, when I moved on to Mills, one of my first jobs was to take a broken booklet, Touche, and, fix it. And this was a extraordinarily complex instrument, which was half S 100 Z 80, or a rather ti processor. It was half digital, half analog. And I had to understand everything to get the thing working again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So, you know, it was a lot of good exposure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, no doubt. Well, but also it kind of puts you in a position. It's not that many people have ever had to crack open a touche and figure out what the hell it did. So that kind of puts you in the position of having some very unique experiences. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. Now there's another thing that I want to talk to you about, because I got wind of it when we were in New York, and when you first mentioned it, I thought that you might be a little insane. And, subsequently I hear that you accomplished the task, which makes me know that you're insane. And that is that you took on the Williams mix and did a recording of it, correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I, well, yeah, I did, many performances of it. No, I did a recording. It's on a, it's on a rap cd, but I'll, I'll get to that <laugh>, Williams Mix is a piece by John Cage, a tape piece that he composed in 1952 and completed in 1953. And at the point he found a certain liberation from time by considering a piece over length that is, this is a tape music piece. So instead of note, note length is now literally length. And he was, building this piece by looking at the length of tape and, in inches. And instead of deciding where the notes are, deciding where the splices would be and what sound should happen in each splice. So the conception of the piece is really about, okay, notes are samples, samples come from different families, which we can represent with six letters, A through, excuse me, A through F, and then we're gonna arrange it in a piece, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2603.905" data-end_ts="2604.125" title="2603.905" id=c_"2603.905">__sl__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2604.245" data-end_ts="2604.365" title="2604.245" id=c_"2604.245">__a__</span> score. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So he made the score, which was really the, cutting template for the tape. Now, because tape goes at 15 inches per second, and each page of the score has 20 inches of tape represented. Each page is one second and a third. And this piece, which is 254 seconds, takes 192 pages, 192 page score to represent. And there are eight tape tracks. You can think of 'em as eight instruments playing. So there, there are eight of, you know, eight lines going at the same time. I see. So, but he did make a score and he published it, and to me it was like, oh, you know, a score is an invitation to do this piece. And, and I also thought, well, there are not many scores around for people who do tape music. Right. You know, so, and I do that. So I thought, I'm gonna do this, and, no one's done it before. And I just sort of did a little calculation. Okay, if I, if I measure one page a day, I can do this whole thing in about a year, you know, I'll just take my time, you know, don't overdo it. And then, about a month after I decided that I got a concert engagement for three months up <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And it was a, it was a cage anniversary concert, and I thought, okay, I gotta do it <laugh>. And so then it, then it was like, you know, as fast as I can go, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It went from being very relaxed to not relaxed at all, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b><laugh>. No, but, you know, I'm, I'm a programmer, I'm a recording engineer. We're very often doing things that take long, long periods of time, and you don't get any enjoyment until the end. So you just think about, yeah, I'm doing something good. I previously worked on a, a Morton Feldman piece, called for Philip Guston, and I worked on the mixing of that. The recording was done with a persistent click that came from expanding fluorescent light bulbs. About every two to five seconds there's a click in the tape. And this is a piece that is five hours long. So my <laugh> my job was to take all the clicks out of this. And in answer to your question, am I in insane? Yeah. Kind of <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>But rather I don't, I I like working on, you know, weird music and, this is, you know, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2760.005" data-end_ts="2760.085" title="2760.005" id=c_"2760.005">__is__</span> what I want to do.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's, what's what's interesting to me though is, is sort of like, you know, that's a thing of significance. And I, to what extent was the fact that nobody had done it before, kind of an interesting challenge to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, I, the only recording I heard for a long time was this one from, I guess it was a concert around 1958, and it was recorded with microphone. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, so you're, you're not, you're hearing the crowd, you're hearing the speakers fairly far away and you can't really hear the piece later. Larry Austin reconstructed the piece using the original tapes, so you're able to hear a clean version. My interest was, well, there is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2801.685" data-end_ts="2801.805" title="2801.685" id=c_"2801.685">__a__</span> score and, you know, you can hear like different versions of Fontana mix by a cage and, and compare them. And I thought, well, let's see if we can make a new version of Williams Mix, will it be the same? Right. And will it have the same character? And the other thing is I thought, well, as soon as I measure all the things in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2820.725" data-end_ts="2820.925" title="2820.725" id=c_"2820.725">__the__</span> score, my dataset is maybe gonna be useful to other people who wanna perform it, that, now they can, I mean, now they can go to my webpage and download my, my spreadsheet, which has all the data from the score, and then maybe <span style="color:red" data-ts="2834.905" data-end_ts="2835.125" title="2834.905" id=c_"2834.905">__can__</span>, people can, they can study it, they can make their own pieces. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And I just wanted the piece to become Yeah. Performable again. So yes, definitely the fact that no one had done it, and that cage intended that this to be a piece that was performed. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2849.555" data-end_ts="2849.845" title="2849.555" id=c_"2849.555">__They__</span>, yeah, I definitely was motivated by 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That. So what is it that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2852.825" data-end_ts="2853.045" title="2852.825" id=c_"2852.825">__you__</span>, you used to implement, the Williams Mix? What tooling tooling did you use to actually create the piece? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, I'm a, I'm a very good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> programmer, and so I, I built a whole thing in pd and really the patch took me only about a week to build. It's really, it's a sample player. It, it has many different ways of playing the sample according to Cage's score. It has fade <span style="color:red" data-ts="2878.185" data-end_ts="2878.405" title="2878.185" id=c_"2878.185">__ins__</span> and fade outs that can be picked by chance. Lots of different things in it, manages tons of sound files, but it really wasn't that difficult. And yeah, I also, I also set it up so it could handle various different kinds of venues. I can go into different speaker setups, and if I have the full <span style="color:red" data-ts="2895.445" data-end_ts="2895.685" title="2895.445" id=c_"2895.445">__eight__</span> speakers, it's discreet, but if I have four speakers, I can emulate it, all the way down to two speakers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. How many, how many sample files did you have to gather up in order to, in order to produce this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, well, cage recommends 500 to 600 samples. And when I started, I was collecting samples by, basically I reached out to a lot of my musician friends, and I thought, well, this would be nice to make it a collaborative process. So I had maybe 20, 25 people contribute samples to this project. And when I got to about 500 samples, it started to feel like Williams Mix. It really started to take that character. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Interesting. Now, how hard was it to go through the score and sort of interpret Cage's intent? I mean, did you find things that you had to just like, make up because the intent wasn't necessarily clear? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>It's, it's really clear. I mean, the, the hardest thing is that the paper and the images are somewhat poor, and you have to measure things that are very faint. So I did a lot of Photoshop enhancement and all that, and I actually turned to some computer graphics researchers, and they gave me a list of all the lines on the page. But that didn't help. So, you know, <laugh>, it, it was, it was a lot of work. The scores actually pretty consistent once you got into it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2978.565" data-end_ts="2978.765" title="2978.565" id=c_"2978.565">__It__</span> definitely had a, a system worked out, and, the score did not start until that whole system worked out. And the densities are consistent, and you can see the form within the piece. It's built in a, a sort of hierarchical manner. So it's, it's fairly worked out and it's actually part one of William's Mix, or the end of the score says end of part one. He did have more structure planned out, but the piece never got built. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I, I bet it was a lot of work for him. <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3010.485" data-end_ts="3010.765" title="3010.485" id=c_"3010.485">__Yeah__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No doubt. No doubt. So going back, like on your reasoning for doing, doing this or, or doing other things, I am always curious when people take on sort of improbable projects or projects that have like an almost imposing, you know, it's like things that look like climbing K two <laugh>, you know? Yeah. By whatever, by whatever means you get there. I mean, this is one of 'em, it looks like, it looks like too overwhelming of a task to be able to take on. So it's hard to imagine starting, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. But they're all, everything's like that. I mean, if you wanna become a good musician, you have to practice an awful lot. And that's like climbing K two, you know? I mean, you, if you really wanna be good at something, you, you have to work. And the, the, the myth of geniuses is a myth. You don't just arrive at these things. All these things take tons of work to be any good at all. So I mean, for me, I'm just attracted to what I think are, are special projects. I know that some are gonna take a year, some are gonna take a month, and some, you know, when I mix a cd, I usually try to make it take a day because I know I can do it that fast, but I don't worry about time for a project except when commercial interests are intertwined. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I can, I can see how you, how you are thinking about that. That makes a lot of sense. Now, if you could, open or give me a glimpse on what are some of the improbable things you're thinking of doing in the near future? I'm curious about what's gonna come outta your next neck of the woods next? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, those who know me know that I've been toying with convolution again, and I do want to do some synthesis using convolution. Not, you know, using impulse responses to give me resonances and make a, some sort of workable synthesis framework for convolution that's coming up. I have ideas as far as, you know, there are ideas I shouldn't talk about. <laugh>, <laugh>, I, there are other, some other pieces I'd like to do. There's an Alvin Lucier piece called Gen Fire, which I've been wanting to do. But a lot of things in the hopper. I do wanna rework some of my educational materials. I think I've gathered a lot of knowledge over, over my years, and I really want to lay a bunch of it out there so that people can have access to it. That's right. Now there's, there's more ideas. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I am really gonna be anxious to see what you come up with. And, for people that are gonna be interested, you've mentioned several times than on your website, you have material on, on different things. Where should people go to check this out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, if you're interested in Williams Mix, you can see it on my website, tre.ucsd.edu. And from there you can get to the code. You can get to versions by clipping by myself on my SoundCloud. If you go to sound hack.com, you can find most of my software. And if you go to make noise music, you can find all of my modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Awesome. Yeah. And now, now that you mentioned it, so I just recently interviewed Jonathan Snipes and, and, a really interesting and, knowledgeable guy, but so how did Williams Mix end up getting tied in with those guys? How'd that happen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>They, contacted me and said, oh, well, we like doing a, a piece of, algorithmic music as sort of our outro, you know, and so, and they said, are, you're the Williams Mix guy, right? Yeah. And, but, but it turned out we're, we're sort of connected through a lot of people from Cal Arts and Rabu and those type of people. And so we're all friends of friends. So I said, yeah, I, I, I'd be into doing that. And they said, well, let's do William Williams mix using samples from our next, cd. And I said, well, yeah, but you have to give me 500 to 600 samples in John Cage's category. And I thought he'd say, no, maybe not <laugh>, but he, like two days he got back, he goes, yeah, we'll do that. And then like a week later, he had all the samples. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So he, he sent them to me and I did, maybe nine or 10 performances <span style="color:red" data-ts="3273.445" data-end_ts="3273.605" title="3273.445" id=c_"3273.445">__of__</span> Williams, mix different variations, and, sent 'em back to him. And, and I think they used about six of 'em on the various releases. So if you get it in vinyl, you get one. If you get the CD in Japan, you get a different version, you know, but, but yeah, it, it was special to me too, because I learned about electronic music and, you know, experimental music from listening to rock records in the seventies. Right. And I thought, well, if I can put a strange piece of music on a rap cd, this, this could be a connection for someone. Right. Open up the world a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Well, Tom, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to talk. It was fantastic catching up with you. Fantastic to hear the stuff that you've been working on, and to hear some of the stories behind them as well. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Oh, thanks Barry. Thanks for inviting me. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3325.285" data-end_ts="3325.365" title="3325.285" id=c_"3325.285">__a__</span> pleasure. My pleasure. All right. I'll catch you again soon. Bye. Okay, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Bye-Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I hope that you're having a great change of the time day today, if you're in the US anyway, if you're a European or Asian listener, you know, I'm talking about, although if you're European, you're probably at the Ableton Loop conference anyway, so just say hi to everyone there when you get a chance. Otherwise, thank you so much for continuing to listen and for, checking out this interview with Tom. Tom's an amazing guy with a incredible breadth of work. I hope you get a chance to take a look at some of the stuff that he's been doing, amazing guy. And I was so pleased to get the time to talk to him. And, with that, I'm gonna turn it over for the week. Thanks a lot for listening. Make sure that you share this with people that you know, who you think might be interested. If you have any questions or comments, shoot me a line ddg@cyclingseventyfour.com. Other than that, see you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3384.045" data-end_ts="3384.245" title="3384.045" id=c_"3384.045">__luck__</span> next week. Bye.
