<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I'm doing a live in-person, chat with William Matheson. You would probably know him best as the WMD guy. And, I got to first run into his work. A couple years ago I did a review for a magazine of one of his guitar pedals. It blew my head off. It was so cool. And then, he started getting into modules about the same, you know, when I was getting into modules. And, I've kind of bounced in and out of different, WMD modules. And it also turns out that he's got quite a little production facility, so we're actually in his office, in his production facility. So I just got a tour around, got to see some of the equipment that makes modules that we all know. So, with that I'm gonna say hi to William. Hi William. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William Mathewson: </b>Hey, doing great Darwin Thanks 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A lot for letting me come by for a visit and for showing me around that. First of all, that was really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>For sure. Yeah. Thanks for, for setting this all up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. This is, this is neat. And, I'm really glad to get to talk to you because to me, in to my mind, you're doing some of the most inventive modules, that are being put out there right now. Thank you. I really find your stuff to be, pushing the envelope of what people are doing now. I think a lot of people when they think about modular systems, kind of think, sort of like a modern equivalent of the mold, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah. Of course. A lot of people want to do kind of a standard subtractive synthesis thing, and that's great. It sounds great. There's a lot of companies out there that make really nice modules that are based on that old stuff. And it's, it's a lot of fun to be able to hook 'em up in a different way. And, you know, not the MiniMogue fixed architecture, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But you make stuff with names like the Hat <span style="color:red" data-ts="122.725" data-end_ts="123.045" title="122.725" id=c_"122.725">__Drunk__</span> Liar, <laugh> <laugh>, which quite frankly, it looks like you need a, a nuclear physicist degree just to figure out what's going on there. Yeah. It looks like incre some incredible complexity in some of the stuff you've been doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>I try to, when I approach a new design, I always try to think of something new. I don't base my stuff on things that have been done or try not to. I mean, there there's only so much you can do with electronics and how things go together and make, you gotta make something that operates in the musical domain. Right. But I try to come up with stuff that's gonna be either interesting or weird or just a different approach than, than what's been done. Like, especially compared to classical synthesis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And, and what's interesting to me is, is that a lot of times you're sort of pushing the envelope in terms of what people expect out of a, of a musical instrument. I know certainly in having played around with like your, your VCAs and your envelopes, some of the timings are shockingly fast. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, in comparison to what people are, are typically used to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>I, I do a lot of that development on the oscilloscope and I'll say, I bet I can make that faster or make it do, you know, make it do something that I can see before I go to how it sounds. Right. So, like with the, the, I guess regarding VCAs, the digital VCA was a joke. I was talking to suit and t guy on the phone and he said, you know, what would be stupid? Why would we do this? But if we made a digital VCA, it's the most analog thing there is VCA. Right? And let's make it digital. Let's make it complicated. Let's make it weird. And then I looked at it, I said, you know, I know how to do it. We could do it with a digital potentiometer. And then you get your, you have like some aliasing that'll happen 'cause you have to sample the cv. Right. And ended up that in the, the data sheet for the digital pot that I use, <span style="color:red" data-ts="242.125" data-end_ts="242.245" title="242.125" id=c_"242.125">__the__</span> analog devices thing, there's a zero crossing detector that I looked at and I said, oh, this is actually, this would be super music there, <laugh> if we did this. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All of a sudden the joke becomes, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>The joke becomes this great module that people use for eliminating pops and clicks. Right. And making, you know, really tight baselines. <span style="color:red" data-ts="260.065" data-end_ts="260.285" title="260.065" id=c_"260.065">__So__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That, that explains, 'cause I was wondering how something that was, that responsive wasn't as click prone as, as, <span style="color:red" data-ts="269.455" data-end_ts="269.805" title="269.455" id=c_"269.455">__other__</span> other things I've used. That's interesting. I hadn't thought about that. But that is something that you would get in digital domain, isn't it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yep. You have the power to make things wait in digital. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>You have the power of time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The power, digital power of time. Yeah. So I'm, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is asking people about their background. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And how they got to be the maker, creator, builder, artist, or whatever. And you know, I would say in your work, you, you really kind of combine all those things because you have, you do some, you do some highly technical stuff, you know, certainly the oscillators. But, but even really, you know, I take a look at your, your, the MME mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the multi-mode envelope, which is an envelope that sort of embodies every envelope, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>With that, I wanted to make an envelope that, so I looked at a bunch of reference designs, old stuff, a DSRs, I wanted voltage control. Right? So, but I didn't want to do it in kind of the, the classical, I don't wanna use rass Right. To make, to change your resistances. Right. So what the multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="338.165" data-end_ts="338.405" title="338.165" id=c_"338.165">__mount__</span> envelope really is, is a triangle, core VCO where you it, instead of it running all the time, it just has a, there's a microcontroller that tells it when to go up, when to go down, and then there's feedback for determining the curve of each segment. So it's, it's not a standard envelope generator Right. At all. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="359.885" data-end_ts="360.005" title="359.885" id=c_"359.885">__a__</span>, it's a VCO that's been heavily 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Modified. That's crazy. Well see now I'm like learning about what's knocking around inside of your head. That's actually, that's pretty interesting. I, I would've never thought of <span style="color:red" data-ts="371.245" data-end_ts="371.365" title="371.245" id=c_"371.245">__a__</span> envelope <span style="color:red" data-ts="371.945" data-end_ts="372.165" title="371.945" id=c_"371.945">__as__</span> really being a special case oscillator. That's pretty cool. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. So I'm curious, and one of the things I like doing on my podcast is, is talking to people about the background, their background. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> how they get to be what they are. Sure. Yeah. How does someone get to be this combination of designer, manufacturer Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But also a lot of your stuff is very, has has a lot of artistic built into it too. How do you combine all those things? Where are you coming from that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>That <span style="color:red" data-ts="398.645" data-end_ts="398.805" title="398.645" id=c_"398.645">__<crosstalk>__</span>? So I started out being a musician in high school, playing around. I was in the demo scene and doing trackers on the computer for a long time and liked sampling, like, messing around with that and had, access fire virus. My parents bought me, which was super cool. So that got me into doing synthesis <span style="color:red" data-ts="418.625" data-end_ts="418.845" title="418.625" id=c_"418.625">__on__</span> the digital side, but on the very analog kind of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interface 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Feeling. Yeah, yeah. Analog feeling. Yeah. And then I was lucky enough to land a gopher ship in a recording studio. So I'd go get coffee, I'd do evening recordings of like high school bands and choirs, and I'd hang out with the, the engineer and owner, <span style="color:red" data-ts="442.845" data-end_ts="442.965" title="442.845" id=c_"442.845">__a__</span> guy named Jeff Gray, who lives in Boulder, Colorado, still runs his studio. Some of you probably know him, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="448.995" data-end_ts="449.285" title="448.995" id=c_"448.995">__Yeah__</span>. And interesting. And, he just let me hang out and learn about recording and sitting on sessions and, and get some chops up working with signal flow and, and stuff like that. And then, I always had some interest in electronics. So tinkered made some pedals that never really sounded good in high school. And, and, I made a little rack of distortion boxes that were just guitar effects pedals put into a rack mount system Oh, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>For, for running my own stuff through. So I'd always tinkered. And then college, I had a couple clients through the studio that wanted custom pedals. So I made 'em, and tweaked a couple things, did what the clients wanted and said, you know, this is kind of cool. Maybe I should look into this some more. See if we could turn this into a real thing. And so I did a short run of 10 fat <span style="color:red" data-ts="504.305" data-end_ts="504.525" title="504.305" id=c_"504.305">__man__</span> pedals, which was our first envelope filter. Okay. And sold a few of 'em. And then did a run of 80. And, and then, reached out to Sean Cleary Analog Haven, and he bought the first 10. And I was like, well, this, you know, now I'm actually in business <laugh>, I can, I can do this. Right. And then, okay. I spent a summer, I had a day job working as a mechanical engineer and then spent my evenings in the summer working on the Geiger counter, developing it, taught myself assembly language for that, and threw some parts together to make a distortion circuit and <span style="color:red" data-ts="545.285" data-end_ts="545.365" title="545.285" id=c_"545.285">__the__</span> tone control and hooked up all the interface stuff for the micro and made this thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>And then, so I sent one to Sean and he bought 25 right away. He called me at like eight o'clock at night <laugh> and said, I want, I want 25. I want 'em immediately 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>And that was when it really started to take off. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I'm curious, how did you get from, 'cause this is the point where electronics kind of halted for me for about 20 years. I, I was into guitar pedals and I actually got to the point where I made a nice little rack mounted thing where I was able to put all my pedal boards, you know, tear the pedal boards out of the pedals Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and put 'em all in this thing so that I had a nice rack full of stuff. Yeah. But I never made the next step, which was like modifying and then like building stuff from scratch. How did you make that leap? Because that to me seems like a pretty big 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Chasm. I just sat and messed with stuff really. I just sat in my, my garage and had a, a pedal that I built from a kit or from you buy the circuit board and <span style="color:red" data-ts="612.805" data-end_ts="612.925" title="612.805" id=c_"612.805">__build__</span> it up. And just seeing what I could short out if I could make it do something <laugh> and it's kinda, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.405" data-end_ts="619.485" title="619.405" id=c_"619.405">__is__</span> really basic circuit bending 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Stuff. Yeah. I was gonna say, it sounded, it sounds like, it sounds like classic circuit bending Yeah. Except you ended up with products out of the back end of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah. Well, I'd, I'd take something and I'd apply the little bit of knowledge I had at the time, which was, you know, it's how to make an op-amp work and invert something, add these two signals together and then you could make this subtractive distortion type thing. Sure. You know, a lot of this stuff never came out 'cause there's just lots of time of things, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Experiments screwing around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Right. Screwing around making sounds <laugh> and eventually turned into Okay, I have, I think, what is enough original stuff to actually make a real product. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, now I'm curious about the, about the step from going, making distortion boxes or like envelope followers, which there's some like classic designs that you could at least be informed in. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to the geer counter, which is this wave, like wave form follower kind of a thing. It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>It's, it seems more complicated than it is. Okay. The Geiger counter is, there's a distortion and then there's a computer. It takes a, there's an analog to digital converter, turns your signal into numbers and then spits it back out with a digital to analog. Okay. And there's a little microcontroller in there, and all the microcontroller is really doing is, it reduces the bit depth on the input. It applies a mask to it, so you get less fidelity out, it slows the rate at which it's sampling things. That's your sample rate knob. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. And then there's a wave table modulator. Sounds complicated, but it's, it's just a, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A rem mapper basically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah. It's a lookup table. Yeah. Right. It's a lookup table. And a bunch of interesting waveforms that I drew in my graphic calculator, <laugh> figured out how to get it to, to be a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="740.525" data-end_ts="740.645" title="740.525" id=c_"740.525">__a__</span> binary and, you know, just program it into the micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="745.465" data-end_ts="745.685" title="745.465" id=c_"745.465">__as__</span> a lookup table. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So when, when did this came come out? When did Geiger counter first 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Geiger <span style="color:red" data-ts="750.005" data-end_ts="750.205" title="750.005" id=c_"750.005">__Counter__</span> came out October, 2008. 2009. Okay. It was 2009. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. It seems like it was a lot longer ago than that. Yeah. There you go. That's, that's really cool. So now, one of the things I'm curious about, it sounds to me like, like Sean, Sean <span style="color:red" data-ts="769.945" data-end_ts="770.365" title="769.945" id=c_"769.945">__Cleary__</span> at Analog Haven was pretty much responsible for, like, wedging you into the business world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah. He said he took the Geiger County, he sold quite a good number of 'em and helped put me in business and said, you know, I'm doing a lot of Euro modules, this would be a cool piece. So he invested in me and said, you know, here's, I'll buy the first a hundred and make them Uhhuh. So I've worked on it over, I think it was the next summer and ended up with the Geiger counter Euro module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Had you met him much before that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>I never met him in person. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. He just, you know, it's, it's funny because Sean is like a thread that, yeah. Kind of exists through. I've done interviews with a number of different modular makers and he <span style="color:red" data-ts="821.385" data-end_ts="821.605" title="821.385" id=c_"821.385">__can__</span>, he consistently comes up as an important influencing factor on this industry. Even existing, 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>He's the guy who would send people money, myself included, and say, make something. I can sell it, and then you'll make more. And there's no contract, there's no, it's just an over the phone or email deal where he just wants the first shot at something and he wants you to design your thing. Right. And put it into a format that he can sell. And he's responsible for making the industry what it is. <span style="color:red" data-ts="856.605" data-end_ts="856.685" title="856.605" id=c_"856.605">__Of__</span> course. He started out a lot of these companies, a lot, a lot of us guys from, you know, 2008, 2009, 20 10, 20 11 really got us to make stuff and to, to turn our kind of DIY hobby thing into real businesses. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So now, since the, since the development of that first Geiger counter module, you now have a pretty full range of products. I mean, you have enough to do more than one kind of synth voice. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> at 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>This point, I think we've got 16 or so WMD modules and then Andrew <span style="color:red" data-ts="892.475" data-end_ts="892.965" title="892.475" id=c_"892.475">__Morelli__</span> from SSF and I put out a line of 10 modules that debuted at the beginning of this year at the W-M-D-S-S-F collaboration line. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what, what to you, is the differentiation between those two product lines? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Those two, Andrew and I developed 'em together. Okay. We co engineered those. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yep. Interesting. Okay. Yeah. But like, if somebody is looking, looking to get some modules, what, how would, how do you expect the customer sees the 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Difference? So the concept behind the W-M-D-S-S-F stuff was we both wanted to make kind of more basic modules that were interesting in their own way. They were really good at what they did, but they weren't, they weren't like crazy modules. They were basic synthesis modules for kinda more standard 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Sentence stuff. And so we worked together on it. We didn't want to put out two totally separate lines, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>So we decided collabor to collaborate on it sense. <span style="color:red" data-ts="955.045" data-end_ts="955.165" title="955.045" id=c_"955.045">__Yeah__</span>. And the modules came out really, really well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Now, when did, when, when I first saw those, they were also in one of the new monolith cabinets. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I think it was in fact your first prototype maybe 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah. Of <span style="color:red" data-ts="969.525" data-end_ts="969.645" title="969.525" id=c_"969.525">__the__</span> monolith. So the monolith is a keyboard case that we basically bought from Dave Phipps from Super Synthesis. Oh, it's his case. He did the design work on the case. Yeah. Yeah. We worked with him a bit to spec it out for what we wanted. Right. And, and, and bought him from 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Case I didn't realize, you know, because I remember that thing. And, and mostly what I remember about it was that it was unobtainable, it seemed <span style="color:red" data-ts="997.005" data-end_ts="997.165" title="997.005" id=c_"997.005">__Right__</span>. Mm mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, I always thought, I always thought, well, that'd be really cool if I could get one of those, but I will never be able to get one <span style="color:red" data-ts="1005.265" data-end_ts="1005.485" title="1005.265" id=c_"1005.265">__of__</span> <laugh>. And then, and then you came out with it and I was like, all right, well, this is gonna make it so that they're gonna be available. I didn't realize that it was actually built <span style="color:red" data-ts="1013.165" data-end_ts="1013.365" title="1013.165" id=c_"1013.165">__off__</span> his design. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah, yeah. We, we saw it. He sent one to the NAMM booth that we were at, and we, we just, we jumped on it. We said, I love this thing. It's great. It's, it's gonna make a really good product, so we just need to fill it with modules. And Andrew and I were working on our set of stuff and just put it all together and it timed out. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That, that certainly makes sense. Well, again, the idea of taking maybe some more basic modules, but combining with the keyboard front end Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that just really puts that, that really makes a fantastic entry system. Yeah. Especially for people that are coming from something like Anxi virus or something where they already have a sense of synthesis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>That's what we wanted. There's, it's not for, it's not gonna be somebody's first synthesizer Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's too expensive. It's 2,600 bucks. Right. Right. But it can be somebody's first modular system if they're coming from a MiniMogue. Right. Coming from a virus. Yeah. Yeah. Coming from home place where they're in a fixed architecture and they want to be able to experiment more. Right. But still be able to play it. It's for players. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's really, that's really smart. And it's a really sharp looking system too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Right. Yeah. It came out really beautiful. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1081.285" data-end_ts="1081.445" title="1081.285" id=c_"1081.285">__Yes__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So in all the modules that you've been involved in designing and, and, and, and putting out, what's your favorite, what's like your personal, my favorite? What's your personal piece? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>My personal favorite module that I've designed is the reine Uhhuh <affirmative>. It's, it's just weird. And it has a really, like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Magic. I've never magic used <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.525" data-end_ts="1101.685" title="1101.525" id=c_"1101.525">__tool__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really? Can you tell me a little bit what

<p>
<b>William: </b>It is? So it's, the idea was I have this filter chip, and it requires a high speed clock. It's a switch capacitor. Filter. Okay. Filter sounds pretty good. At first I was trying to do a multi-band, parametric equalizer with it, but you get too much band crosstalk <span style="color:red" data-ts="1120.485" data-end_ts="1120.645" title="1120.485" id=c_"1120.485">__with__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1120.645" data-end_ts="1120.845" title="1120.645" id=c_"1120.645">__the__</span> clocks. So I decided to make a synth module out of it, and I wanted to do it all analog. It requires a clock that is 50 or a hundred times your cutoff frequency. Okay. So you get a one kilohertz cutoff, you need a hundred kilohertz clock. Sure. Right. So that's relatively easy to do with like a microcontroller and do it digitally. But I wanted to try and do it in analog domain <laugh>. So we, I, I came up with a, it's just a standard software VCO and then a phase lock loop to multiply the frequency. Okay. And most of the sound of the filter is from the phase <span style="color:red" data-ts="1161.705" data-end_ts="1161.985" title="1161.705" id=c_"1161.705">__lock__</span> loop. Ah, fighting with 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Fighting with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1164.505" data-end_ts="1164.785" title="1164.505" id=c_"1164.505">__itself__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1164.785" data-end_ts="1164.985" title="1164.785" id=c_"1164.785">__Cheryl__</span> course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That whole thing, phase lock loops are amazing because you do, it seems like they never work, right? Yep. They just work in the interesting ways, <laugh> Yeah. They're always, 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>They're always glitchy. It's this feedback thing where you're always, you're behind and then you're trying to predict Right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1182.785" data-end_ts="1182.985" title="1182.785" id=c_"1182.785">__right__</span>. What's going on. You have overshoot and undershoot, and if you balance it, it's, it's phase locked. Right. But then when it's not, you get all these really interesting glitches. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, that's interesting. That's, that's, it's funny that, that would be, that would be what makes it, what makes it special to you? Is it just because you tripped on something and 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>It's, I built the whole thing on a breadboard with just playing with parts. And it was one of the first designs I'd done that with in a long time where I, I didn't really have, I had a concept of what I wanted it to do, but I let it happen organically just by tinkering and playing. And I had the whole thing breadboarded out before I ever made a prototype. Right. Most of the time I make a prototype on a PC board and it's surface mount, and I cut traces and have to hack it all up. But this, this time I had the whole module more or less done before I even went 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Pro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1241.185" data-end_ts="1241.385" title="1241.185" id=c_"1241.185">__board__</span>. Yeah. It was just a really fun experience to do it that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, now you have, you have kind of a, you have a working environment that's gonna be different from most in that if you want to do a surface mount board, it's a matter of going into the next room. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Well, <laugh> It is. It is and it isn't. So when we started out, we did two through hole designs, the the Fatman and the Geiger counter. Okay. At first. And then we poured it over the Geiger counter to surface mount. And shortly then after the super fatman was all surface mount, everything <span style="color:red" data-ts="1277.765" data-end_ts="1278.045" title="1277.765" id=c_"1277.765">__past__</span> then was surface mount. Okay. But we didn't have a pick and place machine, so we did everything by hand with tweezers and a soldering iron one part at a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Time. So when you're talking about, we went to lunch and he mentioned something about building boards with tweezers, I thought you were talking about using tweezers on a through hole. You're talking about doing hand doing surface milk <laugh>. That seems to me like a sure way to at least lose your eyesight. At the very least, it's, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>We've got these magnifiers and it's about having good quality irons, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Guess. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>God, you're having the right tools that you get, you know, the three star tweezers and it's, it's not so hard <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I don't know. It still sounds, it sounds overwhelming to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah. One of my guys, Phil, who's, who's still here, he started with me in 2008, is, used to do that day in and day out. He'd take apart, pull it outta the bin, put it on the board with tweezers, and it wasn't done with solder past it with the iron. We'd we'd know put solder on half of all the pads and then put the part on and then solder 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The other. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>We still do that today for prototypes. I still build prototypes by hand. It's not worth setting up the pick and place machine for that. It, it'd take, you know, three hours to set up the pick and place to run. Right. A, a single board that we could just do in two hours by hand. So, you know, I don't wanna load a reel onto the machine 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>30 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Times to pick up one part, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One kind. Yeah. I get it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's amazing though. That's, wow, I, I didn't realize that that's what you're talking about when you're talking about tweezers. That's unbelievable. So you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1374.485" data-end_ts="1374.605" title="1374.485" id=c_"1374.485">__saying__</span> that really <span style="color:red" data-ts="1375.215" data-end_ts="1375.565" title="1375.215" id=c_"1375.215">__these__</span>, some, those first kind of production runs after the through, but some of those production runs were all literally beads of sweat on the board. Yes. While you were putting little <span style="color:red" data-ts="1386.685" data-end_ts="1386.925" title="1386.685" id=c_"1386.685">__piece__</span> on a time, 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>The first 500 Geiger counter pedals, the first 300 Geiger counter modules, I think the first 300 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1399.665" data-end_ts="1400.085" title="1399.665" id=c_"1399.665">__Hadron__</span> colliders. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unbelievable. Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah. Yeah. A lot of stuff. We got the pick and place machine Right. Our first one right around a little after I'd gotten orders for the ine and the face displacement oscillator. And that's when I said, okay, well these <span style="color:red" data-ts="1415.215" data-end_ts="1415.375" title="1415.215" id=c_"1415.215">__part__</span>, these boards have syncro dine has, I think 280 parts. Okay. So to do one, it's a lot of hours. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Indeed. A lot of time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and, and then all of a sudden you hit the economics of saying, is there any way I can charge enough for this to cover that time? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b><affirmative> and the timeframe people wanted them. And I was booked out, you know, six months just on that stuff. That's, and that's with me working and not doing design work. Right. Yeah. So that's, that's unsustainable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let's talk about that a little bit because I find it you now do manufacturing for a lot of people. Yeah. And, you get to see sort of like the quantities <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.365" data-end_ts="1457.525" title="1457.365" id=c_"1457.365">__people__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.525" data-end_ts="1457.685" title="1457.525" id=c_"1457.525">__work__</span>. When I first started getting involved in, in modular stuff where I wasn't just a consumer was when I was working with Grant Richter. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> doing the very first wired modules. And back then a run of modules was like doing five modules. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And then you would, kind of wait around and people would send money and hope that sometime in the next two years you might make one. And conversely, you know, we'd make these modules and you, you, it, there was so much expense involved and all that stuff that you couldn't make a bunch that were gonna send on a shelf. There was no such thing as retailers at the time Yeah. That were gonna hold any of the inventory anyway now, it certainly seems like, I mean, just in terms of talking to people that are doing retail sales and stuff, they're buying in quantities that just never existed back then. I mean, the, the business of modular synthesis has turned into something where quantity actually matters now. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah. A typical run for us is 300 to 500 pieces. Really? Wow. And then smaller reorders, but in an initial run that'll last us a year, Uhhuh, which is, 'cause we don't want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1532.685" data-end_ts="1532.765" title="1532.685" id=c_"1532.685">__to__</span> be doing reruns right away 'cause that's not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there's expense involved <span style="color:red" data-ts="1537.325" data-end_ts="1537.565" title="1537.325" id=c_"1537.325">__then__</span> it's setting 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Up Oh yeah. All the setup, right. All the, you know, test fixture setup and just everything all at once. And you save money when you buy more parts. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah, of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>So we try and do really large runs so that we can sit on 'em for a year. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> including all dealer sales and everything. Right. So that, so we don't have to do it that often. It's just, it's simpler. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So like, how many, I don't even know this off. I mean, I can name like four, but I know there's a bunch more. How many retailers are there right now out there? Are there a dozen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>There's at least 25. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really? Yeah. Oh, interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah, worldwide. There's, there's quite a few worldwide and there's, there's more and more coming up all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Like, I know the couple, the couple three in the US and the Schneiders, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1583.905" data-end_ts="1584.125" title="1583.905" id=c_"1583.905">__but__</span>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah, there's, there's quite a few more in the US now. Yeah,

</p>

</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Rock and Roll Vintage. Oh, that's the, that's a one parent company. Yeah, it's called <span style="color:red" data-ts="1608.825" data-end_ts="1609.045" title="1608.825" id=c_"1608.825">__Sin__</span> City. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. I've heard of them. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yep. Yeah. Interesting. They've popped up recently. I mean, rock and roll <span style="color:red" data-ts="1614.925" data-end_ts="1615.125" title="1614.925" id=c_"1614.925">__Vintage__</span> has been around a long

It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1619.005" data-end_ts="1619.045" title="1619.005" id=c_"1619.005">__big__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Up out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's, and there's a lot of modular people there, surprisingly. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe not surprisingly given big of a city <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.835" data-end_ts="1627.125" title="1626.835" id=c_"1626.835">__Yeah__</span>. <laugh>. But, yeah. So it's, it's really kind of a changing business now. One of the things that I heard a lot last year, at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1636.845" data-end_ts="1637.125" title="1636.845" id=c_"1636.845">__Damm__</span> show was people starting to talk kind of like a little scared about, you know, there being a modular synth bubble and it's gonna all burst and, you know, it'll be like 1981 again when everybody goes broke. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. That certainly doesn't seem like it's happened. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Well, it's impossible to predict the future. Of course. You never know what's gonna be cool, but <laugh> we're also with the internet and in the world we live in, we're at the, there's no more monoculture anymore. Now. Everything is cool. You can do anything. And it's, it's in, it's cool. You find your niche. So it, things don't really go, come and go in fads unless it's major mass market. We're still in a small enough market where we don't have to care what people are into because there's enough people into what we're doing. We get to do it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well. And yeah, it's, it's sort of, is kind of the sweet spot of boutique stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is that you have, you have people that are interested in what you're doing, but now to what extent do you think that, continued growth in the market is gonna be based on innovative designs rather than just pumping <span style="color:red" data-ts="1709.805" data-end_ts="1709.965" title="1709.805" id=c_"1709.805">__out__</span> modules? 'cause I, I would think that we at least have to be at the point where a stock A DSR, there's plenty of, we don't need, we don't need more of those designs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Yeah. Well, there's starting to be a little bit of race to the bottom stuff where people are coming out with cheaper and cheaper modules and that, you know, we'll see what happens with, you know, especially things being made overseas. If we start seeing $30 full featured oscillator modules and stuff, we're going <span style="color:red" data-ts="1740.525" data-end_ts="1740.605" title="1740.525" id=c_"1740.525">__to__</span>, it's gonna price out some people, but it's also not, because most of us established guys have our high end market. We're, we're in the high end of, of the market. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Although, although it's funny to me, and this is, this is the thing that makes me love modular stuff, because prior to modular modular, I had tons and tons of keyboards and keyboards come in, in, unit costs of $2,000. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But modules you can, you can get a unique fun or even sometimes amazing module for a couple of 300 bucks. Yeah. You know, so in, in very first world terms for an affordable amount of money, you can get some really unique designs. Now, I, I'm curious about how you see marketplace really supporting that because you're a designer <span style="color:red" data-ts="1800.185" data-end_ts="1800.475" title="1800.185" id=c_"1800.185">__Yeah__</span>. As well as all the other stuff. So you know exactly how much sweat goes into one of these designs. As do you feel, do you feel like you get enough return on the design or enough financial return to support the continued work of design? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>I generally make things work at, if I can do just this one run, it's gonna be, it's gonna pay my bills. It's gonna be, I'm gonna be fine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're gonna be, you're gonna be pleased with 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1829.995" data-end_ts="1830.075" title="1829.995" id=c_"1829.995">__It__</span>. I can do one run and it can be as small as a hundred pieces. And that will be, I, I'm not planning on doing a thousand of right <span style="color:red" data-ts="1838.415" data-end_ts="1838.635" title="1838.415" id=c_"1838.415">__of__</span> $800 module <laugh>. That would be, that's, that's insane. You're gonna, you're gonna lose your shirt on that. Yeah. Right. So, so as far as design goes and continued innovation, I think that's what's gonna help drive the continued growth coming out with new interesting things. And that's been really possible with all of the, the cheap arm microcontrollers that have come out. You're getting a lot of really great digital modules with analog interface now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> so much more so than was possible five years ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1874.975" data-end_ts="1875.195" title="1874.975" id=c_"1874.975">__So__</span>, yeah. Well, it's interesting you say that. 'cause like five or six years ago I actually kind of sniffed around doing some of that and extraordinarily, I mean, so expensive. It was clear that there wasn't gonna be a way to, to come out of it alive. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> financially. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. And so that was, that is kind of interesting that that's changed. But also back in the day when I was working with Grant, there was no equivalent <span style="color:red" data-ts="1903.665" data-end_ts="1903.825" title="1903.665" id=c_"1903.665">__to__</span> the manufacturing facility you have here. Mm-Hmm. Right. Yeah. So at that time, it was a really, it was really messy time to try and do electronics because most of the companies that were doing assembly, were kind of excited because they were getting a chance to make cell phones. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so for them quantities of less than a million were ridiculous. Didn't matter. Yeah. You weren't even on their map. Right. Yeah. And, you know, to try and get face plates, I remember the hell hole we went through to try and get face plates made and then try <span style="color:red" data-ts="1937.625" data-end_ts="1937.745" title="1937.625" id=c_"1937.625">__and__</span> get things ized. And Grant, of course, wanted wacky artwork on it. So that was like four more horrible processes. Yeah. And the whole thing was just a mess. And it seems like now because of facilities like yours, things like metal photo and some of these other <span style="color:red" data-ts="1955.825" data-end_ts="1955.985" title="1955.825" id=c_"1955.825">__places__</span>, metal 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1956.305" data-end_ts="1956.585" title="1956.305" id=c_"1956.305">__Photos__</span> made getting face plates quite a lot, lot easier. Yeah. I used to do at three local shops, I'd get 'em laser cut aluminum, take it to get anodized and then take it to get silkscreen. It was terrible. And it was terrible to drive all over the place. It took a long time. It was eight week lead time Yeah. To get my panels done. Right. So now metal photos like, you know, three to four weeks and you get your design in and everything's usually pretty good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So it's, it's really amazing that, that this kind of stuff can happen. Now what, where do you see, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1992.175" data-end_ts="1992.295" title="1992.175" id=c_"1992.175">__I__</span> you, you're in the interesting position of being kind of at the driver's seat of seeing people with modular ideas. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> come walking in the door and saying, can you make these for me? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, where do you see a lot of, a lot of the innovation coming from? And I asked this from a very specific standpoint. Okay. So I teach, I teach in a local art school, and a lot of art education now is involved in sort of, very simple electronic design. Oftentimes using an Arduino or in some cases an board, but almost always <span style="color:red" data-ts="2023.215" data-end_ts="2023.415" title="2023.215" id=c_"2023.215">__an__</span> Arduino and some supplementary electronics and stuff like that. And I'm curious to, to know, do you see those people kind of moving into the design phase? 
</p>

<p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. You, I tell you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2083.805" data-end_ts="2084.095" title="2083.805" id=c_"2083.805">__your__</span>, your hand, your hand soldering surface mount stuff you're doing assembly code. I, from what I can tell right now is you take a look at a thing and you say, what's the hardest way to do <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b><laugh>? But it's really just, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How you accomplish it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Well, it's the way though that, I guess it's the way I know and it's the assembly thing is, okay, how do I make something that I can totally know it's gonna be critically timed and be as fast as possible with as cheap of parts as possible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually a, that's a really interesting story and that's kind of an interesting thing to think about because they're again, talking about designers that are maybe not super skilled either in the coding or the electronics. I mean, an Arduino system gives you the feeling like you're really working close to the metal. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2136.775" data-end_ts="2136.895" title="2136.775" id=c_"2136.775">__But__</span> actually that Arduino language, you're 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Pretty far 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Away. You're far away 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>From, from what I understand on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, you know, having done it, just like the amount of the Arduino system does a lot to make sure you don't cock it up. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so every time, you know, every time you do an analog read it actually like it slots some time when you do a standard analog read, it does some timer based stuff. Conversely, when you do, every time you do a digital read it first checks to make sure that you're in the proper input or output mode. Right? Yeah. So it does a whole bunch of, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>There's a lot of extra lines of assembly cut, a lot of extra clock cycles going on to make sure that, just to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Make sure you didn't mess up something up. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And so that, that's where I can see the assembly just ends up. You, when you're done, you know exactly what's going on on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>I can count clock cycles, like on the Geico counter I did this, I had a couple different routes depending on what things were happening, what the modes were. And I entered no instruction cycles so I could make sure that <laugh>, no matter what it was doing, it was gonna be the exact same time for making <span style="color:red" data-ts="2206.425" data-end_ts="2206.645" title="2206.425" id=c_"2206.425">__the__</span> sample. Each branch, each sample. Yep. All exactly the same. So in that you can do that in assembly 'cause it's, you can count your clock cycles, it's known, you can look it up on the data sheet. Everything's very, very exact. I can't port this to any other micro controller. Right. I can't, I can't move my code anywhere. And if I make a tiny mistake, it's really hard to find, but it's a trade off. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you say you can't port it, but I mean, first of all, with, with all, with these kind of microcontrollers, I mean, you probably have a couple of standards you work with and so I do, your stuff is reusable across 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Different knowledge is reusable. Some of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2244.805" data-end_ts="2245.045" title="2244.805" id=c_"2244.805">__stuff__</span> I, I'm not <span style="color:red" data-ts="2246.045" data-end_ts="2246.165" title="2246.045" id=c_"2246.045">__a__</span> formally trained software engineer, so my code is sloppy and it's not really done to, in a way that you'd want to hire me to do code <laugh>. I can write a simple button user interface, you can hire me for that. But as far as, you know, I wouldn't be comfortable writing a DSP algorithm Right. In assembly. Even if I could do it, it would not be something that anybody else could look at and would be able to make sense of. Sure. I see. Yeah. That's, it's the level of being a professional software engineer versus not, I'm not. Right. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, well, but it's interesting because I think an awful lot of people can kind of scope your background, which is you start off getting coffee at a recording studio and, that's, that's probably pretty heartening to a lot of people would be like, you know, I, I like to experiment, I like to try things and maybe opens the door. Now, what do you see in the future? I'm always curious when, when I talk to builders and, and kind of inventors and I would, I would claim you are part of the inventor class. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because some of your designs are just wacky. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Try to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2316.525" data-end_ts="2316.685" title="2316.525" id=c_"2316.525">__embedded__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Alright, we'll call it that thing. Yeah. But I always like to ask, what do you, what does the future look like from your, your side of the goggles? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>It's hard to say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2330.985" data-end_ts="2331.205" title="2330.985" id=c_"2330.985">__eh__</span>, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2331.765" data-end_ts="2331.925" title="2331.765" id=c_"2331.765">__can__</span> give you the answer that, doesn't say anything. No. I think the future is gonna be good for modular. People still want to get away from computers. People are trying to be more creative. You're seeing more installation artwork that involves electronics. Modular is an ex, not an extension, but a parallel to that in the art world and the music world. So I've seen people gigging with modules, with modulars, with just modulars. There's a lot of it. And it's, it's people trying to come up with a way to be creative with technology that is new and expressive and trying to do things that haven't been done before. So I, I see a lot of potential for continuing on the path we're on. So, and I don't, I don't think there's gonna be any new format that's going to eclipse modular. Of course. That's the famous last words, right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> from 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Analog synthesis tomorrow, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2392.585" data-end_ts="2392.805" title="2392.585" id=c_"2392.585">__All__</span> of a sudden 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Digital 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2394.285" data-end_ts="2394.525" title="2394.285" id=c_"2394.285">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2395.275" data-end_ts="2395.565" title="2395.275" id=c_"2395.275">__Yeah__</span>. Well, analog tape, all of a sudden you have pro tools. Right. You know? Right. It's, but I think we're kind of slowing on Moore's law and slowing on technological advancements regarding creativity. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. So I'm in your office and behind you, it's a whole bunch of modules that you're either playing with or testing or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Or have to fix or have 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To fix. <laugh> in front of you is a computer system, which where you probably do your designs, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.685" data-end_ts="2423.885" title="2423.685" id=c_"2423.685">__Yep__</span>. Behind you is a guitar and a guitar amp. Yep. Do you still play, first of all? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Not, do you play 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2430.585" data-end_ts="2430.805" title="2430.585" id=c_"2430.585">__Key__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Music much? Not really. I wish I did. I don't have the time. Yeah. Yeah. I bought a electron analog rhythm. I was gonna get back into doing beats and stuff like that have, you know, do some live techno and I haven't touched it in months. Oh, that's, there's just no time, unfortunately. My, I get my art outlet by doing designs. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, that makes sense. And, and you did a great job. Now let me ask you something, and I'll ask you in a as personal way as I can. Let's say that you, like me, had a 15-year-old kid Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you want, and he expresses some interest in electronics, in music and art and all that kind of stuff, much like his dad. Where would you point him? Would you point him towards something like modulars? Would you point him towards something like circuit design? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2482.225" data-end_ts="2482.445" title="2482.225" id=c_"2482.225">__Oh__</span>, would you point him towards get a fricking guitar and bash on it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>There's that and there's a lot to be said for shut up and play <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Right. So I, if they're interested in electronic design, I'd say build some kits that, and I, I get like interns and people coming to me occasionally that want to get into what we're doing Right. From a design standpoint <span style="color:red" data-ts="2505.205" data-end_ts="2505.325" title="2505.205" id=c_"2505.205">__and__</span> say, all right, that's, that's great. You've got a good idea, but you don't know how to do it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you don't know how to start doing it. How you start is, here's soldering <laugh>, here's wiring, here's stuffing aboard. These are all the things that you need to be really good at before you can design something. Design takes all the stuff that you know, and make something new out of that knowledge. So if you don't know how to do anything or you only know how to do some things, then you're not gonna be a great designer. You gotta <span style="color:red" data-ts="2539.525" data-end_ts="2539.685" title="2539.525" id=c_"2539.525">__learn__</span>, you gotta be really well versed in variety of things. Sure. In my, in my opinion, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That I can't think of a better place to, to end than that. That was, that was really cool. Well William, thank you so much for your time. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>William: </b>Appreciate it. Absolutely. Thanks for having me, Darwin Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have a good one. Great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And with that, I want to thank William for, spending the time with me. If you are not familiar with, WMD modules, WMD guitar pedals or any of the work that he's done in collaboration with SSF, you need to check it out. You don't have to search far in your, in your Google search clause to find what they're doing. And, they're handled by all the major retailers. You're gonna find something you love. Believe me. I want to also thank all of the listeners that contributed to my, my Kickstarter fund. It was that recorder that recorded this interview as well as having served as a backup for the last several. I want to thank you all. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2611.005" data-end_ts="2611.125" title="2611.005" id=c_"2611.005">__I__</span> made it fantastic. And I want to thank all of you for listening, for sharing with your friends and, for enjoying the work that I'm enjoying so much. Thanks a lot, and we'll talk to you soon. Bye.
