<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I am really pleased to have a very special guest. His name is Jean <span style="color:red" data-ts="16.07" data-end_ts="16.27" title="16.07" id=c_"16.07">__Mark__</span> Peltier. He is the person who is behind a piece of technology that a lot of people use or have used. It's called the cv, Jitt Objects. And, and basically it was an opportunity for people who are users of Macs to take advantage of some of the technologies related to computer vision. And I have seen so many projects that use the c v Jitt systems. It has become a really important part of people's Toolbox. Now, unfortunately, over time they started getting a little brittle as some of the underlying max technology changed, as well as some of the underlying operating system technology. But just recently, a number of people at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> have been working with Sean Mark to put, to, to update, this object set and make them again, available for people that are using Max seven, so that they can get back into play with this computer vision stuff. I'm really excited about that. It's going to be launched, off of a website called ology.club. I will have a link to that on the, on the podcast website. But beyond that, I am really interested to talk to <span style="color:red" data-ts="91.18" data-end_ts="91.47" title="91.18" id=c_"91.18">__Sean__</span> Mark. So, <span style="color:red" data-ts="92.9" data-end_ts="93.19" title="92.9" id=c_"92.9">__Sean__</span>, mark, welcome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc Pelletier: </b>Well, thank you. It's a pleasure to be here, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I appreciate you taking the time. Now, I'll let the listeners know I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="102.63" data-end_ts="102.83" title="102.63" id=c_"102.63">__talk__</span>, I'm talking to you in the mid evening my time, but it's early morning, the next day in your time, because you are in Japan right now, correct? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. What are you doing out there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Well, currently I am teaching in, university the Nego. Nego. <span style="color:red" data-ts="120.38" data-end_ts="120.67" title="120.38" id=c_"120.38">__Okay__</span>. University of Art and Design. Actually just started working here since April. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. Interesting. Well, fantastic. Can you, tell us about, beyond, beyond teaching, what are you, what are you working on right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Well, currently I'm just selling into my new job that's <laugh>. I see, taking a lot of time, and, and trying to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="144.13" data-end_ts="144.35" title="144.13" id=c_"144.13">__to__</span> think of what I'm going to do next, next. I mean, this, you know, change of job was, was, I hope is going to be an opportunity to be, to start new things, but I'm just trying to think of what I, I wanna do. I, there's lots of things I wanna do, but try to decide what I really wanna do. And, so yeah, there's nothing really, in, in the short term plan, but, hopefully a lot of interesting things, are gonna be happening in the mid and long <span style="color:red" data-ts="176.47" data-end_ts="176.63" title="176.47" id=c_"176.47">__term__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. Well, I, my, I'm going to go under the assumption that the listeners, understand some, at least what computer vision is. And, and maybe a bunch of 'em will be aware of how the CV <span style="color:red" data-ts="190.78" data-end_ts="191" title="190.78" id=c_"190.78">__jet__</span> things have impacted the Max community. But, in my podcast, one of the things I always want to know about is how people became the artists that they are. And in your case, I'm specifically interested because, my interactions with you and your work have always been fascinating, but always, there's always a depth there that I appreciate and sometimes maybe even find a little intimidating. But I'm curious how you got to be the, the artist that you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Well, it, it's going to be a long answer, but, at the core of it is that I can't focus on one thing and I can't see something that I like without also wanting to do it. And that's been with me, you know, ever since I was, I was born, I think. So, at the very beginning, I guess it, it started around 1984. I was about eight, nine years old at the time. And, that's when I got my first computer. It was a Commando R 64. And, that's also when I started programming, because I had no choice. You needed to have some basic to just interact with the thing. Right. And I couldn't get any software because there wasn't any place, you know, selling cassettes anywhere near where I lived. And so the only way I could get software was to buy books and magazines that had code listings and just transcribe the programs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And, when I ran out of cassettes to, to record the programs, and I just had to like type the program every time I wanted to use it. So that's how I got started in programming. And around the same time, I was, very much, even though I was pretty young, I was very much into art. And, I started taking, painting lessons. And, also, I was also very much into music. I loved classical music, and I started taking piano lessons and learning music. And, and I, I wanted to, I wanted to be a, a musician. I wanted to be an artist, and I wanted to, to keep on working with computers. And, and I wanted essentially be everything <laugh>, right? <laugh>, and, but I was very, very much in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="325.78" data-end_ts="326" title="325.78" id=c_"325.78">__in__</span>, into classical music. And, I like classical music because, well, because of, of the, the, the power, I, I felt it had to, to convey emotions, but also because, the way that some of it was, capable of, evoking very strong mental imagery. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>I would, you know, close my eyes and, and listen to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="350.59" data-end_ts="350.88" title="350.59" id=c_"350.59">__well__</span>, especially <span style="color:red" data-ts="351.24" data-end_ts="351.48" title="351.24" id=c_"351.24">__like__</span>, late 19th century composers. And I would just like, imagine all sorts of, of landscapes and stories and, and, and images. And, and that was, you know, very powerful experiences. And at the same time, also, this was the eighties, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="365.96" data-end_ts="366.08" title="365.96" id=c_"365.96">__I__</span>, I just hated the music on radio. And it was all synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="371.3" data-end_ts="371.52" title="371.3" id=c_"371.3">__Bob__</span>, and it was all clean and slick. And, and a lot of it was very mechanical. It was the, the age of midi. And I hated all that because it was very much unlike the classical music that I loved. Right. And so, I, I just hated synthesizers. It was like <span style="color:red" data-ts="385.44" data-end_ts="385.64" title="385.44" id=c_"385.44">__the__</span>, the symbol of all that was wrong with music in the eighties. And I couldn't believe that everyone was listening to the, to that. And, and so I was just like, you know, listening to, to my, my Beethoven and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="399.32" data-end_ts="399.56" title="399.32" id=c_"399.32">__<inaudible>__</span> and <inaudible> cassettes and, and just wondering what, why everyone was listening to synth pop. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>So that was the, the eighties. And once I got into the nineties and I started becoming a bit more proficient in programming and writing my little, my own, you know, text adventures and, and graphical games and, and, you know, it was all in basic, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="419.2" data-end_ts="419.36" title="419.2" id=c_"419.2">__it__</span>, it was, but essentially, yeah, I, I got into gaming and it was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="423.82" data-end_ts="424.04" title="423.82" id=c_"423.82">__it__</span> wasn't just, I couldn't just play the games I had to make them to. And, eventually when I came time to go, to university, I, I, I got into movies, so I, I would go to the theater, you know, at least once a week. I would, you know, rent movies almost every day. And I was just really into movies, and I couldn't just watch movies. I had to make them to <laugh>. And, I, I've always been like that, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And, and so, because that sort of coincided with, with, you know, going to university. I, I thought I, I'm gonna, you know, become a filmmaker. And, there were two places that I was considering both in, Concordia University. I'm, I'm from, Montreal. Okay. Montreal, Canada. And so there was Concur University there. I ended up going to the, the communication studies department, because they, they taught film, and also they, you know, they, they taught lots of other things. And, and it ended up, ended up being a really good move because I, I can't focus on just one thing, right? And, so I went there, and by that time, I had, I sort of like reconciled myself with electronic music because the eighties were over. And, and the aesthetic of the nineties was very different. It was all this very moody and gritty music that was coming out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="500.76" data-end_ts="500.92" title="500.76" id=c_"500.76">__You__</span> know, it was like trip hop and, and acid jazz, right? And it was like I I I d m <span style="color:red" data-ts="506.16" data-end_ts="506.36" title="506.16" id=c_"506.16">__what__</span> was, was coming out. And, and suddenly, like, electronic music didn't just have to be, you know, slick and mechanical. It could also be very moody and also evoke the, these strong, you know, images and, and, and emotions. And, and, and of course, I couldn't just then just listen to electronic music. I had had to make it right. Yeah. So, so then I thought, well, maybe I'm gonna try to take some, some classes at the music department. And, so I, I, I called up the music department and they suggested I, I, I take a class called Electroacoustic Music, because, you know, a lot of communication studies, students <span style="color:red" data-ts="543.8" data-end_ts="544.08" title="543.8" id=c_"543.8">__were__</span>, were taking it. And I really didn't know what I was getting into. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And I, I registered and, I didn't know what electroacoustic, I knew I had electro, so I thought maybe I'm going to learn something. You know, it had something to do with electronic music. And, on the first class, the first piece of electronic music that I heard, was by, Montreal composer, <span style="color:red" data-ts="567.68" data-end_ts="568.08" title="567.68" id=c_"567.68">__<inaudible>__</span>. And, you know, a lot of composers in Montreal are, are working in, in a style of, you know, French, acumatic music, music ette. Sure. And sometimes it, it gets called, cinema for the Ears, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="584.6" data-end_ts="584.72" title="584.6" id=c_"584.6">__Z__</span> Bay's music is very much like that. And I heard the piece, and then it wasn't, it was extremely vivid, you know, images that, that I, I was seeing, it was like, really, there was a, a movie happening in my mind as I was listening to those sounds. And I thought, wow, you can do movies and music at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And I, I thought, <span style="color:red" data-ts="604.47" data-end_ts="604.76" title="604.47" id=c_"604.47">__well__</span>, I really wanna do this. And, at the same time, I realized that I, I love movies. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="611.6" data-end_ts="611.76" title="611.6" id=c_"611.6">__love__</span> thinking about movies. I loved imagining movies I'd like to make, but I didn't like making <span style="color:red" data-ts="617.16" data-end_ts="617.44" title="617.16" id=c_"617.16">__music__</span> movies all that much. I thought, you know, the, the whole shooting process was just not for me. And so I ended up spending most of my time, at Concordia making music, electronic music, electroacoustic music, and also, taking classes in Japanese. And, so I, I, I sort of built up my, my, my own vocabulary, my, and, it was very much like, like painting. You know, I'd been painting for a long time and, you know, instead of layering colors, you were layering sounds, but it, it was, you know, a very non-real time process. You would go out, record some sounds, you know, chop them up and, and, and process them, and then layer them and then edit some more. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And then, and it, it was very, and I, I, I like this, but it was, very much working like, like a, you know, sculptor. And, eventually I ended up, getting into dance. I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="676.68" data-end_ts="676.84" title="676.68" id=c_"676.68">__went__</span> to see some dance shows and, and contemporary dance, <span style="color:red" data-ts="678.6" data-end_ts="678.8" title="678.6" id=c_"678.6">__and__</span> I thought, wow, I wanna do this. But I, I realized that I, I was going to be a terrible dancer. It was just not going to work. I, not for me, right? And I, I thought, well, but I can still get involved in dance because I, I, I do music, right? And, and so I, I started, you know, telling people that, you know, I would, would be interested in working with dancers. And, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="701.1" data-end_ts="701.32" title="701.1" id=c_"701.1">__and__</span> Montreal, it is big, has a big and vibrant art community, especially performing arts. And, and there are lots of dancers. So if <span style="color:red" data-ts="710.04" data-end_ts="710.24" title="710.04" id=c_"710.04">__you__</span>, if you just, you know, say like this, I'm, I'm a computer composer and I would like to write music for dancers, then dancers will come, and say, please do music for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And, and so I, I started collaborating with, with dancers, and that was a big shock because I realized that they had a very different approach to time than I had. <span style="color:red" data-ts="732" data-end_ts="732.2" title="732" id=c_"732">__Ah__</span>, yes. So I, I remember we had a meeting and I asked them, well, how long is the piece going to be? And I was expecting an answer, like, the piece is going to be between eight minute and 32 seconds, and eight minutes and 35 seconds. That was the sort of timescales I was working on. I was, you know, I was working with, with very, precise gestures and phrases that were very crafted, and, and I was, you know, working just when I was editing at, you know, immediately second, level, just getting things right. And they then they, they told me, well, the piece, I, I guess the piece is going to be between 10 and 15 minutes, but probably not more than 20 <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And, and I was just like, I can't work like this. You know, <laugh> just like my, my whole tool set is worthless. And, and I thought, wow, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="787.48" data-end_ts="787.56" title="787.48" id=c_"787.48">__is__</span> going to be a big problem. And they were really into improvisation. And, and, you know, the, the sort of pieces I was writing with all these, you know, very calculated, you know, structures and, and, and phrases and all that, it was just, I mean, it, it forced <span style="color:red" data-ts="799.78" data-end_ts="800" title="799.78" id=c_"799.78">__the__</span> structure on, on, on the whole piece that, that they didn't really like. So I thought, this is going to be terrible. But in the end, things ended up working really well, and we did some, really good performances and ended up writing, compromising and getting rid of all these nice gestures, and instead writing very ambient <span style="color:red" data-ts="819.88" data-end_ts="820.12" title="819.88" id=c_"819.88">__sound__</span> soundscapes, and, and they compromise. And then we, we sort of agreed that we're sort of going to decide on, on, on <span style="color:red" data-ts="827.44" data-end_ts="827.56" title="827.44" id=c_"827.44">__a__</span> length for the piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And what was going to happen within that length. It was going to be a bit open, but still that, that made me feel like, gee, I, I'd like to have like a bit more flexible approach to time. And I didn't really know how to, to approach this, because everyone around me was doing this using the same, you know, techniques of, sort of French school electroacoustic music where, you know, you record, you process, you edit, and everything is, is like a sculpture, right? And, I, I saw around that time, a, a dance performance, I think it was by, the choreographer was, ma and, the, the music was by, another Montreal composer called, Luigi <span style="color:red" data-ts="874.84" data-end_ts="875" title="874.84" id=c_"874.84">__Fa__</span>, who's a little bit older than I <span style="color:red" data-ts="876.8" data-end_ts="876.88" title="876.8" id=c_"876.8">__am__</span>, I think. And I'd, I'd met him a couple of times and, and, I think they were using, what was it, the, the, i I cube system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Oh, yeah. Right, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="887.59" data-end_ts="887.88" title="887.59" id=c_"887.59">__With__</span>, with, with sensors, you know, sensors. So, so the, the dancers had had these sensors strapped on, on, on their bodies, and I didn't really know <span style="color:red" data-ts="896.24" data-end_ts="896.4" title="896.24" id=c_"896.24">__it__</span> was going to happen, going into the, the performance <span style="color:red" data-ts="899.28" data-end_ts="899.56" title="899.28" id=c_"899.28">__anyway__</span>. And when the dancers started moving, then there were these sounds that were like perfectly synchronized, their movements. <span style="color:red" data-ts="907.66" data-end_ts="907.88" title="907.66" id=c_"907.66">__And__</span>, and, and that was, I thought it was incredible. I mean, like, it, it, it sort of was as though the dancers were, you know, were transformed into, you know, something else. There was this audio visual object where, where the, the, the motion of, of the dancers and the motion of the sound was just <span style="color:red" data-ts="926.94" data-end_ts="927.16" title="926.94" id=c_"926.94">__in__</span> such perfect <span style="color:red" data-ts="928.03" data-end_ts="928.32" title="928.03" id=c_"928.03">__sink__</span>, that that was also a, you know, very strong experience. So that was a positive side. But the negative side was that I was very distracted by the sensors themselves, because you had these wires, you know, and, and the costumes were, were very minimalistic, you know, which was good because it, it really emphasized <span style="color:red" data-ts="947.2" data-end_ts="947.32" title="947.2" id=c_"947.2">__that__</span>, you know, the, the natural, movement and, and, you know, the beauty of, of, of the body, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And, but then you had these wires and, and then the, these wireless transmitters. And I started talking to dancers about this, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="959.88" data-end_ts="960" title="959.88" id=c_"959.88">__I__</span> said, yeah, yeah, we really don't like, you know, striping, you know, sensors, under yourselves. And it's, it's very limiting. And, and then, you know, sometimes they fall off and then, you know, you have this, this big transmitter that you can't, you know, if you wanna feel like you're rolling on the floor, you can't do that. And so realized that I didn't, as a spectator, I didn't like seeing those sensors and, and the dancers didn't like using them, but I liked the, the, the product, which was, you know, this very, synchronized <span style="color:red" data-ts="988.44" data-end_ts="988.6" title="988.44" id=c_"988.44">__word__</span> coupling, synchronized type coupling <span style="color:red" data-ts="990.48" data-end_ts="990.68" title="990.48" id=c_"990.48">__of__</span>, of, audio and visuals. I ended up finding an answer in the computer music journal. There was an article by Antonio Cambodia who teach, who, who works at the, university of Genoa. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And, he was describing, the software they'd made there called Ice <span style="color:red" data-ts="1007.82" data-end_ts="1008.04" title="1007.82" id=c_"1007.82">__Web__</span>. And this is where I found out about computer vision. I found out that you could use cameras as sensors and use that in, in dance performance, and that you could capture the movement of dancers without touching them, so you could get rid of the sensors. And I thought, wow, this is great, and, I wanna do that. And, but, then in the meanwhile, I, I moved to Japan, to just, you know, see the world ended up staying in Japan, a bit longer than I was expecting. And I started a master's degree, here in Japan at a school called imas, the, Institute of Advanced Media Arts and Sciences, a a very special interesting school, very small. Also, there were only 40 students at, the graduate school then trying to, you know, study, bit more interactive forms of, of making, electroacoustic and electronic music, and working with sensors and especially, cameras. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And, I had two problems. Then one was technical in that, a lot of the, the good software, like, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1079.82" data-end_ts="1080.04" title="1079.82" id=c_"1079.82">__ice__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1080.06" data-end_ts="1080.28" title="1080.06" id=c_"1080.06">__Web__</span> for, computer vision was running on Windows, and the good software for making interactive art and music, like Max <laugh> right? Was running on, on o s nine, right. And, there were, there was, there was some software for, computer vision on O ss nine. There was a big eye from, from Stein, and of course there was a Ian as, from, David <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.96" data-end_ts="1102.28" title="1101.96" id=c_"1101.96">__<inaudible>__</span>. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1103.4" data-end_ts="1103.56" title="1103.4" id=c_"1103.4">__the__</span>, the techniques that they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1104.4" data-end_ts="1104.56" title="1104.4" id=c_"1104.4">__used__</span> were a bit, I would say long in the tooth. By that time I started using them compared to what I, I was reading and, and I was, you know, studying <span style="color:red" data-ts="1114.34" data-end_ts="1114.56" title="1114.34" id=c_"1114.34">__the__</span> computer vision. There were things I wanted to do that you couldn't do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1118.84" data-end_ts="1118.96" title="1118.84" id=c_"1118.84">__in__</span> these software. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>So when Jitter came out, I thought, well, maybe I can use this. And it was, you know, it was a great software package, but I, I realized there was still a lot of things I couldn't do with it. So I almost, as soon as it came out, I, I started writing, you know, externals for doing computer revision and, things that I, I wanted to do, like, shape analysis and, optical <span style="color:red" data-ts="1143.4" data-end_ts="1143.64" title="1143.4" id=c_"1143.4">__folk__</span> tracking, things <span style="color:red" data-ts="1145.44" data-end_ts="1145.64" title="1145.44" id=c_"1145.44">__that__</span> I couldn't do with the, ex existing packages. Right. And that ended up being CVI Jitt. So at the same time, the other problem that I had was that Yamas is in a small city on the outskirts of Nagoya. Nagoya is a very big, big city, but I didn't have any dancers nearby. And I wanted to, to, to, you know, do interactive music, to work with dancers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And I had finally, you know, the tools to do interactive music, but I didn't have any dancers. And, and that was a fundamental problem for me. And at first, I, I thought, well, I'm gonna try to, to do, you know, performances that aren't necessarily dance. And, you know, I tried, you know, becoming a performer, and that didn't really work out because I'm not a dancer at all. And, and I thought, gee, that's a big problem. And I, it forced me to think about what I really, really wanted to do. And I, I thought about what, you know, attracted me in, in these technologies. And it wasn't so much, dance, for instance, I, I, I mentioned <span style="color:red" data-ts="1211" data-end_ts="1211.32" title="1211" id=c_"1211">__Antonio__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1211.55" data-end_ts="1211.84" title="1211.55" id=c_"1211.55">__Kadi__</span>, and, and he studies, how to sort of extract, you know, ex expressive element of gestures, right? And that wasn't really what interested me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>It was just the perfect synchrony of, of motion, of visual and auditory motion. And, it was, it, it goes back that, that sort of, the power of music to evoke, imagery and, and to go to a place that that's both, you know, visual and auditory at the same time. And, and I thought, I don't need the dancers, and I just replaced the dancers with other things, things I realized that when I, if I use cameras, I could capture just anything because it was a non-contact technology. And I, I, I thought, okay, what, what are things that have interesting motions? And the first thing I I started using was smoke. I thought, you know, if, if you realize, if you have smoke, and it's backlit <span style="color:red" data-ts="1269.75" data-end_ts="1270.04" title="1269.75" id=c_"1269.75">__that__</span>, first of all, visually, it, it's, it's very beautiful, but also it has very complex motion, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1274.86" data-end_ts="1275.08" title="1274.86" id=c_"1274.86">__And__</span>, and very unpredictable motion. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And so the first, you know, serious piece that I, I did like this uhs called, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1282.64" data-end_ts="1283.08" title="1282.64" id=c_"1282.64">__community__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1283.1" data-end_ts="1283.32" title="1283.1" id=c_"1283.1">__may__</span>, which in, in Japanese very originally translates to smoke dance. But, so I use a, a stick of incense with, and I, I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1293.82" data-end_ts="1294.04" title="1293.82" id=c_"1293.82">__use__</span> the camera to analyze the demotion of, of the, the smoke and, and synchronize the, the music, this. And at, at first I wanted to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1302.08" data-end_ts="1302.16" title="1302.08" id=c_"1302.08">__do__</span> this as a performance. I would just like walk on stage, light up a stick of innocence and leave. And, and just that was, that was going to be the performance. But then people started asking me to do this as an installation, and it, it morphed so into more, you know, permanent, semi-permanent installation, because you still have to defeat it, incense <span style="color:red" data-ts="1322.48" data-end_ts="1322.68" title="1322.48" id=c_"1322.48">__in__</span>, otherwise it stops, right? So that's, that was the sort of of work I was doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And that's how I, I got into <span style="color:red" data-ts="1328.58" data-end_ts="1328.8" title="1328.58" id=c_"1328.58">__the__</span> sort of computer vision and stuff. And then I, I went into teaching. I graduated from Yamas and went to another school called Yamas, very confusingly, the International Academy for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1338.72" data-end_ts="1338.88" title="1338.72" id=c_"1338.72">__Media__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1339.12" data-end_ts="1339.32" title="1339.12" id=c_"1339.12">__and__</span> Sciences. There's a graduate school and there's a vocational school. And the vocational school, where I started teaching was, makisu, who was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1350.14" data-end_ts="1350.36" title="1350.14" id=c_"1350.14">__for__</span> a long time, very much involved in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1351.64" data-end_ts="1351.84" title="1351.64" id=c_"1351.64">__Max__</span> community. He wrote, textbooks, max textbooks in Japanese mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, so we, we taught together in, in, in the academy. And I did that for six years and then moved to, another university <span style="color:red" data-ts="1365.1" data-end_ts="1365.32" title="1365.1" id=c_"1365.1">__on__</span>, I teach university. And then for the last, two years, I was actually working as a, officially as a fellow, for a, a game development company. I was making, you know, games. And, so all the while, you know, sort of starting and never quite completing a, a PhD. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And, I was studying, and in PhD I was studying, I realized that, you know, was important, wasn't so much the technology of computer vision, but it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1398.14" data-end_ts="1398.36" title="1398.14" id=c_"1398.14">__you__</span> working with, you know, visuals and, and sounds and trying, not thinking of like, sticking sounds onto visuals or sticking visuals onto sounds, but working, you know, from the middle. And I call this am modal design. You're working with like pure motion, pure shapes, things that aren't yet, perceptible. And then you, you, you sort of project this to vision and project this on onto the sound. And, and part of that process was also how do you reach those sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1433.64" data-end_ts="1433.76" title="1433.64" id=c_"1433.64">__a__</span> little shapes that you can't really perceive? Well then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1437.1" data-end_ts="1437.32" title="1437.1" id=c_"1437.1">__you__</span>, you, you can work from the visual and analyze the visuals, and then from then, you know, sonify them work to sound and then go the other way, but also with the understanding that you weren't just combining them, but also sort of reaching for sort of imperceptible middle ground. And, and it was, well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.18" data-end_ts="1457.4" title="1457.18" id=c_"1457.18">__it__</span> involved, you know, technological aspect of, you know, computer vision and synthesis, but also, you know, psychological aspect of what are some non arbitrary mappings between, sound and, and vision and potentially other senses. So that, that in, in a very, very long nutshell is, is what, what I am <span style="color:red" data-ts="1478.3" data-end_ts="1478.52" title="1478.3" id=c_"1478.3">__and__</span> what I've been doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's really a fascinating nutshell, though. No, <laugh>, I, I have to ask, just because I am, yeah. I'm curious, given, given the way the discussion started with you needing, whenever you saw something, you had to do it. Yeah. And I have to admit that there's, I, I own a part of that, and I think an awful lot of people that do media art do that. And I, I'm curious, first of all, how frustrating was it to have those feelings at a time when there seems to be something new every 12 seconds? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1517.02" data-end_ts="1517.24" title="1517.02" id=c_"1517.02">__Th__</span> this is extremely difficult. And, I, I sort of have to, to discipline myself and, and to just start, you know, saying, no, I, I'm, I'm not going to become a cook <laugh>, because it really, I'm, I really am like that. And, and, and I, the problem is that I've, I've spread myself very wide, but you also end up being a, a bit thin. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1543.58" data-end_ts="1543.8" title="1543.58" id=c_"1543.58">__And__</span>, and you and I have a lot of problem, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1546.84" data-end_ts="1547.04" title="1546.84" id=c_"1546.84">__and__</span> people ask me, you know, what do you do? And, and I, like I say, a lot of things, right? And, I, I'm a, and it's very confusing. I'm a media artist, and people say, well, what do media artists do? And I say, well, lots of different things. And, and it is very difficult and, and frustrating. And I guess that's what I have to learn to just pick a few things that I really wanna do and, and just stick with them for long enough that I, I actually produce something that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1579.56" data-end_ts="1579.68" title="1579.56" id=c_"1579.56">__the__</span> big different difficulty, you know, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1581.56" data-end_ts="1581.76" title="1581.56" id=c_"1581.56">__you__</span>, you, you start lots of different projects and, and you never finish them. And that's what I have to learn to do, to just finish something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really kind of interesting. But it's, it, that kind of obsession, it is something that I think is, is peculiar to those of us, because if you think about it, like the community of media artists, we have a tendency to all be some level of programmer, some level of photographer, some level of musician. You know, it seems like that is almost the, the ground level for that kind of artwork. And I think it, it draws a particular kind of person that has, that has that kind of obsession. It's really, it's really interesting to hear, how deeply into it, you are though. And, and you, you, I mean, you've identified that in yourself, which is actually really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Yeah. I think one, one of the thing that's important I, I realize for me is, is you have to go back to the basics. And this is what I, a bit, what I was trying to do in my, my, my PhD is, is saying, okay, so there are lots of different things you can do. And, and, but what's really fundamental about those things? And especially when you start working with technology, you know, there's like, you know, the new, new tools that keep on coming up <span style="color:red" data-ts="1667.28" data-end_ts="1667.48" title="1667.28" id=c_"1667.28">__and__</span> al almost every day, right? And if you try to, to like chase that, then you're, you're just gonna end up going crazy. And, but, so you have to go to basics. And, and for me, the basic was really, people, you know, the human being. And that's why I, I was interested in, in, in my case, perception, because everything that you do has to go through perception. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And so there are many ways you can do visual media, for instance. But it ends up always having to go through people's eyes. And if you, if you have to understand one thing, you have to understand how people work and, how, how they receive, how they react, how they act, how they think. And then from that understanding, then you have to think of things that you want to do. And only then you have to, to sort of introduce technology and ask yourself, well, this is what I wanna do. What's the proper tool to use? I, I got sidetracked, for a while. I started a project called <span style="color:red" data-ts="1734.3" data-end_ts="1734.52" title="1734.3" id=c_"1734.3">__the__</span>, the Mirage Project, where the question, and I realized later it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1739.52" data-end_ts="1739.64" title="1739.52" id=c_"1739.52">__the__</span> wrong question to ask, is, how can you use, computer vision and art? And it was completely backwards, <laugh>, at first, I, I completely forgot that the reason I got interested in computer vision was that there was a very aesthetic problem that I was trying to solve. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And that had to do with how, how you, you perceive a, a performance or an art piece. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1763.58" data-end_ts="1763.8" title="1763.58" id=c_"1763.58">__the__</span>, the correct tool that I identified to solve that problem was computer vision. But then I thought, okay, I have a good hammer then, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1769.92" data-end_ts="1770.08" title="1769.92" id=c_"1769.92">__and__</span> what can I, you know, smash with it <laugh>. And, and we did <span style="color:red" data-ts="1774.2" data-end_ts="1774.36" title="1774.2" id=c_"1774.2">__some__</span> good pieces, but it, it was just not very entirely productive. And instead it was, I, I think it's much more productive, the sort of thing of, of what do you want to express? What do you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1786.68" data-end_ts="1786.84" title="1786.68" id=c_"1786.68">__want__</span> to, you know, explore as a creator, and then think about what the tools are and that precise time instead of just, you know, checking the web every day to see what, what, what's new coming out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I I think it's interesting that you gravitated towards dancers who are probably, I, I've had a chance recently to start working with dancers myself mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and two things hit me. One is that they're among the least technological artists that there are. Yeah. And at the same time, they seem to be about the most open for anything. Yeah. You know, they are willing to try anything. But, I also agree with you, the sense, the way that they express and interact with time is completely mystifying to anybody who has worked with meter and time signatures and Tempe. But at the same time, you'll watch them work and, you know, they'll use kind of interesting hand movements, and they'll kind of, move their shoulders and their heads a little bit, and that somehow communicates to everyone in the group, not only what they're gonna do, but kind of the timing and the speed of it. And it's fascinating to watch, and it seems completely foreign to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Yeah. Well, I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1868.04" data-end_ts="1868.16" title="1868.04" id=c_"1868.04">__a__</span>, an interesting experience, working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1871.34" data-end_ts="1871.56" title="1871.34" id=c_"1871.34">__the__</span> answers much later when I, I sort of was able to do, you know, interactive music, and I worked on a project with, some of my students. It was a collaboration with, dancers who, again, we're, we're doing improvisation. We had a big problem in that because of, of scheduling, and geographical issues, we, we couldn't, get together before the day of the performance. And so we saw everyone, they, we saw the performance on the performance, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And, and they heard the music when they, they got on stage for the performance. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1906.78" data-end_ts="1907" title="1906.78" id=c_"1906.78">__so__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1907" data-end_ts="1907.12" title="1907" id=c_"1907">__there__</span> was music and there, there was live video also, and everything was going to be improvised. No one had no idea whatsoever what we were going to do. And, we knew that there was a theme. The piece was called Earth and Bodies, and it was supposed originally supposed to be a collaboration between dance and pottery. And that part I think didn't go so well because it's very hard to combine dance and pottery. But what I ended up doing was recording a whole bunch of, of pottery sounds and earth sounds. And I was trying to, I'm just going to, to transform dancer's bodies and into, you know, earth and bodies and, using sound. And, and we ended up, you know, deciding not to tell anyone how we were going to do our, our, you know, audio and visuals. And so even the dancers had no idea that we had, you know, cameras, you know, filming them and that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1962.92" data-end_ts="1963.08" title="1962.92" id=c_"1962.92">__we__</span>, they were, you know, analyzing in real time. And, and we had, you know, data coming in, so the musicians <span style="color:red" data-ts="1969.36" data-end_ts="1969.6" title="1969.36" id=c_"1969.36">__could__</span>, could use the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1970.48" data-end_ts="1970.64" title="1970.48" id=c_"1970.48">__the__</span>, that data to, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1971.82" data-end_ts="1972.04" title="1971.82" id=c_"1971.82">__and__</span> within their performance and, and the video artists also. And, and so as performers, we, we had more traditional controllers, but we could also, you know, fade in and out that these, these very, highly synchronized, you know, elements. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>So because they, they didn't know, about this, you know, they, they just dance. And after performance, their dancer just told me, like, the music was amazing. It's like, it knew was what I was gonna do before I did it <laugh>. And I realized that if it was, a good decision not to tell them how things work, because then, in my experience, then people tend to sort of use it as an instrument. They sort of like wanna play with it as, as, as though it was like a giant thein or whatever. Right? Right. And when they don't know it, then they just know that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2024.31" data-end_ts="2024.6" title="2024.31" id=c_"2024.31">__that__</span> they have this confidence that I can do anything and the music is going to follow it. And, and that was very liberating. It was the complete opposite of having, you know, these sensors, sensors strapped to you and you can't do this because or otherwise it's gonna fall off. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Right. And, and they, they could just be free to improvise and have this confidence that yes, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2044" data-end_ts="2044.24" title="2044" id=c_"2044">__that__</span> the visuals are, are going to follow them, and, and the music is also going to follow them. But also because we were, you know, improvising using more traditional controllers, it wasn't just that, you know, there was also question of, of like answers and, and things that weren't synchronized. And so it ended up being, being a very, successful performance. And I think part of that is that we, we just completely hid the, the technology and we, it, it allowed everyone to just focus on what we wanted to express instead of, of just, you know, the nuts and and bolts of, of the tools. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that's just, I think that's where media artists can, can really learn something from working with, with dancers, because unlike say, a performance with musicians where the existence of the instruments and the playing technique and all this stuff is directly related to the sound mm-hmm. Or whatever dancers are, they provide like a level of indirection. They're, their bodies are, sort of like used to create these, these spaces and these shapes and these movements. And I find, I find, I find using the body as kind of source material is just an amazing thing. Let's talk about, I mean, we just got done talk Yeah. Discussing how, the technology should come second. And I, I really think that you framed it beautifully about, the process. But, we do have in the end some technology. And one of the things that I feel like is important is to honor this sense of where, how you got to the, to the cv, the creation of the CV <span style="color:red" data-ts="2151.9" data-end_ts="2152.12" title="2151.9" id=c_"2151.9">__jet__</span> tools. It wasn't, it wasn't because you saw a technology and you wanted to make it accessible, it was more that you saw a problem that you wanted to solve mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Now, in the end, you created a pretty significant body of work with the C v GTT tools. How much of that was required to, do the specific application you saw? And how much of it was sort of like the technology then inspiring you to go a little further, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>The first release was mostly stuff that I was using or stuff that I thought I might need to use, or stuff that was just easy to implement. Right. And, you know, looking back, I mean, it's been what over, you know, 12 years since the, I released the externals. Oh my goodness. And, yeah, it's, it's been a long time. And, you know, I've, you know, grown up a lot as, as a, as a programmer, as as a developer <span style="color:red" data-ts="2216.6" data-end_ts="2216.84" title="2216.6" id=c_"2216.6">__since__</span>, since then. And I didn't really have a plan because it was just mostly stuff I did for myself. And then after that, then originally I, I, it was just for me and then, you know, people saw, saw the external <span style="color:red" data-ts="2229.12" data-end_ts="2229.24" title="2229.12" id=c_"2229.12">__Z__</span> thought, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2229.95" data-end_ts="2230.24" title="2229.95" id=c_"2229.95">__well__</span>, these look good, you know, you should, you know, share, share them. And, when I shared them, I, I realized that one thing I, I liked about Max is that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2238.4" data-end_ts="2238.56" title="2238.4" id=c_"2238.4">__that__</span> there was a very good documentation and there was clear a lot of work that had been put into making, you know, good tutorials and, you know, there were help files and all this.

<p>

So I can't, you know, just release externals without making decent <span style="color:red" data-ts="2261.98" data-end_ts="2262.4" title="2261.98" id=c_"2261.98">__health__</span> files to go with them. Right. So actually end up spending a lot of time on those <span style="color:red" data-ts="2266.04" data-end_ts="2266.36" title="2266.04" id=c_"2266.04">__health__</span> files, and as the, you know, the, the collection grew, in the last releases, I ended up spending more time on the help files than externals themselves. So I think that that was, you know, important and I thought, you know, you know, honestly, I had no idea how many people were using <span style="color:red" data-ts="2285.9" data-end_ts="2286.12" title="2285.9" id=c_"2285.9">__Max__</span>, but it's has certainly, you know, less people than say Photoshop. Right. And so I thought, well, it, it, even if it's a bit niche, it's still a niche. And then, you know, jitters an add-on to that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>So that's a niche of a niche. And I was, you know, releasing an add-on to an add-on. So like a niche of a niche of a niche. And I thought, you know, if, if like a hundred people download external, that's gonna be great. And in the end, I, I just, I think there were like thousands of people <span style="color:red" data-ts="2310.54" data-end_ts="2310.76" title="2310.54" id=c_"2310.54">__who__</span> were using externals and, and, and then that sort of like became a project onto itself. And so just, you know, I just ended up adding stuff onto it that I thought might be useful. And looking back, there was a, a distinct lack of direction. It was just mostly planning on stuff that Sure. That that wasn't either easy to do or just that I thought might be useful. And there, there's stuff in there that probably I'm sure no one uses and, and I certainly don't use, but just I thought, well, maybe, maybe it might be useful. And I thought just, I'm gonna make it and just release it right away and see if people, you know, use it interesting ways and, and, and sometimes <span style="color:red" data-ts="2352.14" data-end_ts="2352.36" title="2352.14" id=c_"2352.14">__it__</span> people did and sometimes, well, not really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, one of the things that I think, and it's interesting to hear that you put that much time into the help files, because I think one of the reasons why it got a lot of use was that the help files are practically project ready mm-hmm. <affirmative> patches. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And I say that because one of the things that's, that's really fascinating about computer vision is how you can have the same equipment or the same tooling or the same patch or programming, but different source material give you vastly different results. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so I think one of the reasons why your stuff got to be used so widely, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2398.4" data-end_ts="2398.52" title="2398.4" id=c_"2398.4">__I__</span>, the number of student projects I've seen that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2401.34" data-end_ts="2401.56" title="2401.34" id=c_"2401.34">__use__</span> C v GTT stuff is just shocking. And the, but I think some of the reason is is because they can take your <span style="color:red" data-ts="2409.91" data-end_ts="2410.2" title="2409.91" id=c_"2409.91">__help__</span>, help files mm-hmm. <affirmative>, they can look at their environment and they can see something that represents a, an extension of their already existent vision mm-hmm. <affirmative>, right? Yeah. And so as a result, then that ends up being a really fertile starting point, and then they can take it from there and run. But the way that you've done the help files, that initial interaction with the C <span style="color:red" data-ts="2438.56" data-end_ts="2438.68" title="2438.56" id=c_"2438.56">__V__</span> GTT tools is like charming because it does take your thing and kind of extend it just kind of by accident. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, well, I, I use the externals in, in my classes to, and, and just by the way, one thing interesting when you look at, at, you know, the download statistics <span style="color:red" data-ts="2457.08" data-end_ts="2457.24" title="2457.08" id=c_"2457.08">__is__</span> there's like a huge spike in September <laugh>. So school obviously, obviously <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.16" data-end_ts="2462.28" title="2462.16" id=c_"2462.16">__p__</span> and I thought, wow, I don't, you know, keep, keep, you know, very detailed, you know, statistics about, you know, who downloads, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2468.08" data-end_ts="2468.24" title="2468.08" id=c_"2468.08">__so__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2468.24" data-end_ts="2468.32" title="2468.24" id=c_"2468.24">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2468.32" data-end_ts="2468.48" title="2468.32" id=c_"2468.32">__just__</span>, I just have the numbers, but yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2470.44" data-end_ts="2470.56" title="2470.44" id=c_"2470.44">__a__</span> huge, huge spike in, in, in, in downloads in September, and I thought, well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2473.84" data-end_ts="2474" title="2473.84" id=c_"2473.84">__and__</span> lots of people using it in education, I guess, right. And, but that was very flattering because, you know, I was using the tools in my classes too, and that was the, the idea, you know, I didn't, didn't wanna spend too much time, you know, talking about the boilerplate. I just wanted to, to start using stuff and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2491.96" data-end_ts="2492.04" title="2491.96" id=c_"2491.96">__then__</span> see what people wanted to use use. So yeah, I sort of, made the health files as, as the starting points that you could just use and then then build <span style="color:red" data-ts="2501.96" data-end_ts="2502.16" title="2501.96" id=c_"2501.96">__on__</span>, you know, onto. So I'm happy that I'm, I'm not, you know, other people are using <span style="color:red" data-ts="2507.24" data-end_ts="2507.44" title="2507.24" id=c_"2507.24">__it__</span> that way. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Absolutely. I'm curious about what has your attention now, since you have this desire to try and do everything. I mean, it sounds like you set cooking aside, but <laugh> I'm wondering, I mean, especially, you know, in this, in the technological world where we have sort of like the ubiquitous smartphones with cameras everywhere, and sound producing tools everywhere, what in that milieu or maybe in a different area is, has got you fascinated right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Well, I, one thing when you start working <span style="color:red" data-ts="2543.76" data-end_ts="2544" title="2543.76" id=c_"2543.76">__with__</span>, with computer vision, I, I got into that because of, of art and, and dance and performance. And, it, it also opens a door onto, you know, a world I, I wouldn't, you know, have known otherwise. And, I remember reading, a survey, I think it was researchers in computer vision. The question was something like, what do you think are, are the fields that will, you know, benefit from computer vision in, in the future? And art was nowhere on the list. And at the top it was like, defense and security. And of course, you know, people are using, say for instance, these externals to make, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2592.62" data-end_ts="2592.84" title="2592.62" id=c_"2592.62">__art__</span>, but you can also use the same technologies to do surveillance. And, and of course now that's, that's a big, you know, topic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And even before people talk, you know, started talking, you know, very widely about this, you know, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2607.24" data-end_ts="2607.4" title="2607.24" id=c_"2607.24">__as__</span>, as I was, you know, studying the techniques, I realized, well, there's also a really dark side to this, and there's an external I, I actually thought about doing, and then I, I decided not to do, there's, a face detection object there that tells you if there's a face <span style="color:red" data-ts="2622.56" data-end_ts="2622.72" title="2622.56" id=c_"2622.56">__in__</span> the image, but I also wanted to do a, a face recognition external mm-hmm. <affirmative> that would allow you to tell you, to say, well, it is whose face it is. And, and I thought, I'm not gonna do this external because I'm not sure I really wanna make this technology easy to use. Right. Because it has a really dangerous side to it. Right. Even if, if, you know, the Bankos can still make those tools, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2647.16" data-end_ts="2647.28" title="2647.16" id=c_"2647.16">__I__</span>, it is really something I, I, I didn't want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2649.08" data-end_ts="2649.12" title="2649.08" id=c_"2649.08">__to__</span> go there, even though <span style="color:red" data-ts="2650.36" data-end_ts="2650.52" title="2650.36" id=c_"2650.36">__that__</span> there were clearly potential applica, artic applications there, there's that computer vision and also, you know, algorithm process, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2660.64" data-end_ts="2660.8" title="2660.64" id=c_"2660.64">__know__</span>, or have this, this thing that bothers me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>And especially, you know, recently it's sort of, a lot of it has to do with like replacing people. And, and I see that there's, you know, a certain culture and especially in, in, I don't wanna call it Silicon Valley culture, but in, in the, the geek world where there's a certain, you know, amount of glee when it comes to, like replacing people with, with machines. Hmm. And I, I think I, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2687.92" data-end_ts="2688.04" title="2687.92" id=c_"2687.92">__want__</span> to go there and I, it's important for me to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2690.8" data-end_ts="2691.2" title="2690.8" id=c_"2690.8">__technology__</span>, to use technology as a way to, to, you know, connect people instead, and that you have to create a system in which the, the human is absolutely necessary. What I mo moving from computer vision to sort of related fields like, like AI and things like that, and the sort of questions that I'm asking myself now is, is how we can you, make again tools and, and pieces, but that aren't just about, you know, press the button and you're going to have, you know, beautiful music running for like, a decade and then we don't need composers anymore. Right. Instead of, of coming up with systems that, that, like I said, you know, and that's why the dancers are important because, you know, it, it all comes down to, to the people and, and their bodies. And, and so these are the sort of questions that honestly bother me. But, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2744.64" data-end_ts="2744.76" title="2744.64" id=c_"2744.64">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2744.76" data-end_ts="2744.88" title="2744.76" id=c_"2744.76">__can__</span>, if I'm going to make, tools again, I want them to be really, you know, human being required tools. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think it's really important to do that. I think, I think the human element, you're right, there's like the sense and geek culture that every time you move a person out of the picture, somehow the picture gets better. Yeah. And I think maybe, the influence, again of, of dancers and of dancers on art is one of those things that can always bring us maybe back to home because mm-hmm. <affirmative>, while you might be able to make a tool that can make a decade's worth of music, I have yet to see anything that approaches, the beauty of a dancer and, and the human activity of dancing. And so maybe they, they are end up being the cornerstone of our stronghold, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Yeah. It's all, I think it's all about creating a moment and sharing that moment with, with people. I think that's all it, it, it boils down to ultimately, even if you, if you had, you know, the robot, that that would just move, you know, incredibly limit, you know, make these incredible emotions, that would be interesting. But ultimately it's, it's about, you know, bringing people together and sharing something, sharing an experience as, as a creator and, and as, as a spectator and, and as also, and when you make the tools, then you have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2833.36" data-end_ts="2833.52" title="2833.36" id=c_"2833.36">__the__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2833.78" data-end_ts="2834" title="2833.78" id=c_"2833.78">__to__</span> build the tools so that it facilitates these sort of experiences. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Beautifully said. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2842.28" data-end_ts="2842.44" title="2842.28" id=c_"2842.28">__Chen__</span>, mark, I wanted to thank you so much for, taking the time to talk with us. It's just fascinating to hear about both your life but also your perspective on things. I think there's a lot for everyone to take out of it. Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Marc: </b>Well, thank you for having me on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, have a great evening or 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Morning for you. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Goodbye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Bye. </i>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Sean Mark for doing that interview. It was pretty fantastic to hear the many different things that he does <span style="color:red" data-ts="2879.66" data-end_ts="2879.88" title="2879.66" id=c_"2879.66">__and__</span> the many ways he approaches it. I want to thank you for, listening to the podcast. The other thing I want you to do is take a look at maxo, that's M A X O l o G y.club c l u b. That's where the newest versions of John Mark's work is, are put to new site that I and some other of my friends and coworkers at Cycling <span style="color:red" data-ts="2903.92" data-end_ts="2904.44" title="2903.92" id=c_"2903.92">__74__</span> have put together, to try and bring some attention to this and other externally produced work. So please take a look at that. Thanks again for listening and I'll see you next week.
