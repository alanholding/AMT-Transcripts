<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, so this week I have the great pleasure of talking to somebody, somebody I've kind of known for quite a while. His name's James Patrick goes by, JP to most of the people that know him. It seems, James wears a lot of hats and has worn a lot of hats. But the fact of the matter is, you've heard me or you've heard people talk about him, if you've listened to a lot of, podcasts, he has been instrumental in the electronic music and dance music scene in the whole Midwest area, experimental music. He has been, he's sort of like, been a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="59.685" data-end_ts="59.805" title="59.685" id=c_"59.685">__a__</span> important cog in the machinery of all these different things. And, and in addition to that, he's helped and he supported so many people over the years. So it's my great pleasure to introduce James Patrick (JP) how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James Patrick (JP): </b>Great. How are you doing today, Darwin? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. Thanks a lot for doing this. I appreciate you're so busy. I appreciate you taking the time to, to get together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yeah. You know what, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="87.465" data-end_ts="87.685" title="87.465" id=c_"87.465">__am__</span> sorry I've been kind of hard to track down and your patience is greatly appreciated, and I'm really glad that we're getting finally a chance. 'cause I will confirm that we've known each other for a while and I consider you a friend. So thanks for, thanks for your patience and tracking me 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Down. No worries. Well, I, I am, I'm glad to do it. So let's start off by telling people what your current stack of stuff that you do is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="115.185" data-end_ts="115.405" title="115.185" id=c_"115.185">__and__</span> well, let's start there and, and work our way, work our way back. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Cool. I like that approach. Nice. For sure. So my primary project in my life, and this will be the least pertinent to our conversation, is the fact that I'm the father of twin boys who are both four years old and their names are Darwin. Yes. And Ro and Roland <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>We have evolution and techno. There 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And, oddly enough, they both have already diverged into their own kind of creative spirits that are vastly different about as different as evolution and drum machines could possibly be. But there, so that's my number one thing. And, they're redheads and being <span style="color:red" data-ts="163.945" data-end_ts="164.165" title="163.945" id=c_"163.945">__the__</span> husband to my beautiful wife and father to them is my top thing ever. So I'm making a point to not let all the remaining things on my list, which are massive to me, keep me from still being able to be a father to them. You know, like every morning I spend like 7:00 AM until about noon with them, which by 11:00 AM gets really hard sometimes <laugh>, because I have my work projects, like my phone is blowing up and my work is like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="188.045" data-end_ts="188.245" title="188.045" id=c_"188.045">__dang__</span>, I just fight it back and I like, go to the gym with them, or take a bike ride <span style="color:red" data-ts="191.845" data-end_ts="191.965" title="191.845" id=c_"191.845">__or__</span> go to the skate park. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And then when I get to work at noon, sure I have a mountain of shit and I'm five minutes late for everything. But I just spent my morning with my kids and it's, that's great. So, so there's that. So now that that's been said, the, all the, the remaining part of the conversation is probably what's most pertinent to our, to like the inquiry stuff. 'cause parenting is just a rite of passage many of us get to enjoy. But the remaining stuff primarily involves, I'm the founder of this electronic music school in Minneapolis called Slam Academy, and I founded it with a cohort and colleague by the name of Jay Allen. You can probably look up his show on this series, from six months ago or maybe nine months ago. Right. Dr. Allen and I are partners along with a couple other people on this Slam Academy project. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And we are a indie arts school. So we do six month programs and electronic music production, sound design, DJing, mixing and mastering. We're working on a live performance program and a indie or gorilla recording arts program as well. But they're all like crash courses. We offer a ton of stuff online. And my role is the chief Content Officer. So aside from the founder, I'm writing all the classes or working with other experts in their fields to format, help, format the curriculum and get my, my student experience is basically my, I'm its bitch <laugh> basically. So I worship the student experience gods all day long. And it's really great because, in the end it boils down to the, my success boils down to what kind of experience other people are having. And so because of this fact, I've really organically found myself in a place that allows me to like, be as compassionate as I can possibly be for other people every day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And then the be more compassionate I am, the better I'm doing at my job. So that's the secret like flow state Venn diagram of, you know, finding a gig where you can do what you love and what you really believe in and get feedback, you know. And so chief content officer has become my role in the company and it's been fantastic. The other just to stay 30,000 <span style="color:red" data-ts="329.895" data-end_ts="330.245" title="329.895" id=c_"329.895">__feety__</span>. The other things on my list are that my wife and I own an art gallery that's also on its five year coming up anniversary that's can't stay out of the press. My wife is the director and she just is an amazing, amazing co-curator for all of our exhibits. She works with all the people in the art scene in Minneapolis, St. Paul area, and she is my muse and incredible. And she runs that gallery with a force while being a mommy of twins and does it all in the name of the love of, of the arts because we're not living in some weird bubble. There's not a lot of economy behind art gallery, so you gotta love it <laugh> a lot. Yeah. And five years of it while trying to be a mother and a wife and a photographer and all these other things that she does in the arts, we somehow managed to have Gamma Gallery. I clearly remember when my wife when, where, where, where are you at when your, your wife is pregnant and they put the thing on the stomach and they can see the babies, the little gummy bears in there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So sonogram. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yeah. Yeah. There you go. I clearly remember when we all of a sudden saw twins and my father-in-Law was like, so you're starting two businesses and you're about to have twins all in the same summer. Like, are you sure you really want to go through with this? And, I'm really glad we did. It's been hard, but it's been awesome. So we have Gamt Gallery, slam Academy on twins. And then in addition to that, I have my own solo performing arts career that's in music and sound and stuff. I do a live, live hardware performance thing. And I also do a ton of kind of hybrid DJ live performance stuff that's more of these like late night gigs, you know, which kind of has its own category. And then bringing a lot of that stuff, including my band, which I have out to festivals and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>I haven't been doing a ton of that this last summer, but as far as the past, like five or eight years of my life, I've had this band project too, which is kind of another thing, you know, but it's, it's all kind of in this live performance bubble. So I do DJing, live hardware performance stuff, and then I kind of fuse it all together with a band. And that's one of my projects called, James Patrick Plays, that's kind of a rotating kind of soul and funk ensemble. And we play at jazz clubs and private parties and outdoor music festivals. <span style="color:red" data-ts="462.675" data-end_ts="462.965" title="462.675" id=c_"462.675">__That__</span> only happens a couple times a year nowadays. 'cause we're also busy. Unfortunately. It's kind of a fantasy little band. There's <span style="color:red" data-ts="469.525" data-end_ts="469.645" title="469.525" id=c_"469.525">__just__</span> like an old electronic music garage band at this point. So, so that's, I'm trying to think if I'm missing anything. That's the, that's about it. I practice meditation every day and go to the gym. This 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is an amazing stack of stuff that you do. And first of all, congratulations on the kids. Excellent. Naming, excellent naming choices. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Thank you. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. But also congratulations on kicking off two very difficult sounding gigs. It's not only, it's not only that you start <span style="color:red" data-ts="499.025" data-end_ts="499.245" title="499.025" id=c_"499.025">__two__</span> businesses, but that both of 'em are pretty tough. I mean, it's, it's hard to, to do an educational thing because to a certain extent, one of, one of the deals is you're gonna be responsible, for coming up with content that's not only educational, but kind of exciting. Right. That's right. Hard. There has to be, there has to be kind of a entertainment part of this too. I mean, the, the content is entertaining, you know, it's not like you're teaching Fortran or something. Right. But still, there's, there's a responsibility there to be, to make people enjoy what they're doing as well as being, learning about it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Right. That, that was hard. But luckily for me, I feel so inspired by the material and the changing face of electronic music. It's just like, it's wow. I mean, it's an exciting time to live in. You know, it's like in the, the, the, the backlash from the collapsing record industry of the nineties and all that darkness, is this incredible like muck that got kicked up. And now, like we're swimming through this mystery swamp of sounds and resources and, you know, there's, it's, the playing field has been totally flipped on its head. And, the best music is being made by the people who are totally so fresh to it. Offer people the <span style="color:red" data-ts="591.765" data-end_ts="591.885" title="591.765" id=c_"591.765">__right__</span> breakthroughs early on in their creative process. And it changes their life forever in ways that you could never imagine. And that's like what we're doing at Slam Academy, you know, that's, it's not about teaching you how to dj and that's what you think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>That's the bait that's on the end of the stick, right? Like, you're like, oh, you a dj? Come on in, you learn how to dj. And then it's like, ha, guess what? Just kidding. We changed your life and you know how to dj. But it's like, you also know yourself and you understand like the questions that are, you have to ask yourself when you're really gonna start embracing artistry. And not just like collage on this elementary level, but really begging yourself some of the questions. Like, what's your message and what's your point? And what, who are you in the beginning, you're gonna think you're not good enough, and then you're gonna have to keep making shitty sounding music for a while and that's gonna force you to like break down sometimes, you know, that happens. That's part of the artistic process. Self-loathing, because you don't, you know, self-doubt. Very few artists make it to greatness without struggling through these things. And the awareness of these facts, and at least my intimate relationship with it, is what has empowered me to become, to do this stuff. Like, it's even applies to Gamma Gallery, but I'm much more so Slam Academy and keep it inspired and keep it feeling like it's alive on its own, on its own, you know? And I'm just kind of fueling it and it's already happening. It's this force beyond me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Most recording or music tech or art tech programs tend to focus on the tech and don't sweat the art. Right? Mm-Hmm. It seems like you're taking a very different approach that the kinds of things you're talking about here, those are the kinds of subjects you generally wrestle with in art school. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> not a, not a six month blast. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so how do you, how do you take like these big and sort of existential questions and wrap them into the kind of program that you're, you're offering? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Well, I'll tell you this is, it's, this is a big challenge, but it's the secret ingredient to offer something that YouTube University just can't. Right. And it, it forces, I have to tell my student, Hey, you gotta up the bar a little bit. You can't say gimme 30 seconds and or, and if I don't have a boner, this isn't cool. It's like, 'cause you're not gonna get something that meaningful out of just like recipe Fest. And so when I say, you know, hey, for those of you who, if you step it up one notch by sitting back and just breathing and absorbing this and being patient with yourself and not saying, Hey, I have to make a hit tonight or else I'm a loser, no, I have to just be here and keep coming back to it. And that's what it's about. <span style="color:red" data-ts="769.655" data-end_ts="769.875" title="769.655" id=c_"769.655">__You__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="770.025" data-end_ts="770.315" title="770.025" id=c_"770.025">__know__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And then inevitably these deeper things start just happening in the process. 'cause when they first heard Daft Punk or Michael Jackson or whatever the hell it was, that they gave them goosebumps and made them feel like there was something inside of them. It's like, that is all meta. There's no tech there. And they wanna, they wanna channel that initial feeling. You know, we all do. It's like the first time, whatever you, when you were 14, going through puberty, whatever they say, there's that music, those <span style="color:red" data-ts="797.235" data-end_ts="797.435" title="797.235" id=c_"797.235">__music__</span>, those musical experiences you have early in your life that really, where you're like, wait, I'm an adult now and I'm experiencing music on a whole new level that I didn't, it's like those, those reflections stay with you forever. And wanting to channel that. It does make it harder to write a lesson plan. 'cause it's not just like, follow these clicks and boom, you have dubstep or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>No. It's like, this is the language we're speaking. These are the fundamental ideas. Here's the general workflow. Do this every day. And when you start getting hung up, move on, you know, flow, find the flow state and keep doing this until it starts becoming fun. It's like integrating that into the lesson plan makes it harder, but it leaves people going, holy shit, I just signed up for something that's real. Right. You know, and it doesn't happen. Usually on the first lesson I tell you, week one of the six month program, almost everyone goes home and is like, am I in the right place 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And then on week two, they're like, wait, I think something really amazing just happened. And then by week three, they're just like pie <span style="color:red" data-ts="859.625" data-end_ts="859.915" title="859.625" id=c_"859.625">__eyed__</span> and telling all their friends. That's the, that's the goal. You know, it takes a couple weeks and you gotta, for, you gotta, if people can't raise up the bar one notch, then they don't, they don't catch the memo. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, one of the things that's interesting to me is that what you just said kind of flies in the face of what most people think people are like anymore. There's this sense that, you know, some combination of the internet and, you know, I guess now after the election, you know, liberal thought and or some damn thing right? Has caused everyone to turn mush brained and unwilling to have any patience for anything, right? Mm-Hmm. And so what you see is you see instruments being created or software created where the whole thing is like, you know, get you hooked in two minutes, even if it's only five minutes worth of value, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, what in your own experience makes you think that people actually want something better than that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Because of the reactions that I get when it works. I mean, the feedback I get when it works, which is almost all the time when people are willing to make that extra little commitment, is, the feedback that I get is them saying, this is what I was looking for the whole time for 10 years I taught, an upper level elective at a associate's degree audio production program. So you'd be there for two years and after about a year and a half, you'd finally get to the class where you get to plug in the modular synth or do some granular synthesis where you're like, oh my God, I've been waiting for this like a year and a half of Gen edss and moving mics around on kick drums. And, now all of a sudden I get to like even play around with a low pass filter on a real <span style="color:red" data-ts="969.795" data-end_ts="970.085" title="969.795" id=c_"969.795">__Moog__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>You're like, you know, and these kids pay $60,000 or more for these degrees. You know, every one of those students, and maybe this is maybe Slam Academy's model, this whole mantra is maybe a somewhat residual of teaching in this dark cloud space. Whereas students are like, I've already figured out I'm never gonna be able to pay my student loans. So even if this is a real analog Moog at this point, I'm so pissed and so bitter that I'm even here that like, I hate music and even if I still in my heart of hearts wanna listen to music, I'm not gonna like really think that I can just be an artist. 'cause these, you're going to a tech technical career college where a lot of this audio production engineering is taught you have to go out and get a job. And that means like, you know, the whole placement program doesn't validate anything that's arts-based. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>You know, I worked in these schools and it was like I closed the door and like lock the fucking handle and be like, okay guys, I know what you're really here for <laugh>, you know? And they'd be like, oh my gosh, this guy's like a shaman. And I'd be like, no, it's because we all were there and our souls got stomped out. But trust me, if you stay true to that art experience, it's gonna be one of two things. It's either gonna be the best hobby you've ever had in your life and it's gonna make you happy until you die. Or possibly you're gonna end up just doing it all the time and getting so good that you're not gonna need to go put on khakis. You know what I'm saying? And that's pretty, pretty rare. But the downs, the worst thing that could happen is you've now channeled your vision and art through something. And it's like the students are like, Hey, even if I end up paying student loans for the next 20 years for this thing that got me a job at a pizza shop, when I punch out, I go home and I express myself. Boom. And like, and even if I only get a hundred plays on my SoundCloud after six months, doesn't matter. Right? You're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1075.165" data-end_ts="1075.325" title="1075.165" id=c_"1075.165">__trans__</span>, you're transcending the, the machine. Right? That's what, that's what people want. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I've got a, one of the things I do in my podcast is I kind of explore people's backgrounds and, and, and what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1085.785" data-end_ts="1086.205" title="1085.785" id=c_"1085.785">__become__</span>, and it's interesting because you used the word that I actually was going to use this concept of you being sort of a shaman for people because there is this thread of people kind of pointing people in the Midwest, and not just Minneapolis, but throughout the Midwest, kind of pointing to you as, as having been that for them. And you know, a shaman plays many different roles. Sometimes a shaman is a teacher, sometimes a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1113.945" data-end_ts="1114.165" title="1113.945" id=c_"1113.945">__sha__</span> shaman is a therapist, sometimes a shaman is someone who shows you what the right food is to eat right. And sometimes the shaman is learning from you in a way that helps you learn more about yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have seen you in action in all of those roles. Mm-Hmm. And, as well as being a servant to the community as well as a participant. Right. It's been amazing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1142.315" data-end_ts="1142.605" title="1142.315" id=c_"1142.315">__What__</span>, how did you get there? What were your first experiences in the Midwest electronics scene and how did that grow into your work with, with Spark your work teaching and all the other things that you've done? Tell me your, tell me your beginning story. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Cool. Thanks. Good question. I'll give you the executive summary and then you can dig into anything that seems specifically, specifically interesting. So I grew up in the Twin Cities and, I was turned on, you know, by records really early on. You know, I was ju I was born in 1976, so I was just old enough before records were to totally gone. I mean, even before CDs were a thing to where like, if you had music, you had records, you know, and I was just there enough, you know, like the tape thing was cool. As I got a little older, I had some tapes, some audio cassettes. But collecting music became like a hobby of mine early on. And if I could even zoom further back, it was through skateboarding, to be perfectly honest. And I still skate, but I would skateboard, 'cause that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1213.485" data-end_ts="1213.605" title="1213.485" id=c_"1213.485">__I__</span> was like, Hey, I remember being like eight and getting a skateboard and not knowing what underground culture or any of that shit meant nothing to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>It was just a thing with wheels on it. But I started riding it around a lot and then started, you know, going to the skate shops to get more skateboards and they'd have videos, VHS cassettes you could buy and you could watch the skaters. And they all had like baggy jeans and long hair and we're listening to this punk rock music. And so I was like, all right, this is cool. This is some like, kind of underground culture thing I can get with this. And so I was going to the record store, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1245.445" data-end_ts="1245.645" title="1245.445" id=c_"1245.445">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1245.645" data-end_ts="1245.765" title="1245.645" id=c_"1245.645">__a__</span> early like 12, 13, my mom and grandma would bring me to the record store and I'd just buy the weirdest looking shit I could find. I had no idea what Throbbing Grisel was, but I knew that like the name was cool as hell. And so I remember buying a Throbbing Gristle live in like Hamburg Double Pack, like when I was like 13 and like hiding it from my parents. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>'cause I knew they'd be like, what in the hell has gone wrong with you child? So, but I would play that in my headphones and just be like, oh my God. And like, record it to my tape and my double cassette thing and put in my Walkman and go skateboarding on the ramp and listen to Throbbing Gristle and being 13. And like, that was my, that was the beginning of it for me, you know? So through that music and through my connection with Underground Culture and Skate, that skateboarding thing, skateboarding goes hand in hand with B-Boy culture, which is break dancing, right. And hip hop and like groups like the Beastie Boys early on took punk rock and turned it into rap for skateboarders and for punkers and for white kids or black kids. And so it was this like, so it was this innocent fusion of Countercultures that turned me on so much. And it was, you know, through I think skateboarding and that cultural inspiration that led me to really wanting, like, going to some rave parties really early on, like in the early nineties, mid nineties. And then deciding that I wanted to be a DJ and throw raves. So that's what I did. I didn't throw like huge raves. I threw smaller parties early on and stuff like that. But yeah. You were gonna ask a question, DARM. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So first of all, it's a, it's a pretty big and ballsy jump to go from dropping records onto your cassettes to saying, I'm gonna throw some raves. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what was it about going to the rave parties that activated you into saying, rather than being a a attendee, I'm gonna be a participant or I'm gonna be a contributor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yeah. Well, here's where we can cue the classic. My life was forever changed by rave culture kind of line. But it was the community and inclusive nature that I felt when I was on the dance floor that I had never experienced. You know, being 17 and, standing on a huge black dance floor and not seeing anyone's face, but just seeing like glow sticks and shadows and hearing the most incredible bass I've ever heard. DJs like Groove Rider, Derek Carter, Carl Craig, these guys were changing my life, you know, and I didn't really even know who they were. Chicago House DJs, like Paul Johnson, you know, other people like Frankie Bones and the techno scene, Woody McBride here in Minneapolis. Those DJs were banging it and playing stuff that I was like, yeah, this has the energy of the like, skateboard punk rock thing. The underground vibe of the B-boy culture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>I can just dance. You know? And then like, I was just kind of a raver and partying and, through, I don't know what it was. I mean, I already had some records and I was already collecting records. So that part of me, like the idea of putting two on at the same time just kind of became kind of obvious. 'cause I was lucky enough to meet, have a roommate who had an older sister who was a DJ actively in town in the early nineties, and she had a set of decks in their living room and she was like, go ahead kid. And so I came home from work every day from the coffee shop when I was 17 or 18 and just DJ'ed and djd and I got good really fast and I was playing Square Pusher and Apex Twin by then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>That was like 19 96, 19 97, I was playing early Plastic Man Works. I was playing, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.365" data-end_ts="1457.485" title="1457.365" id=c_"1457.365">__a__</span> techer the early like stuff from artists like Bjork to people like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.675" data-end_ts="1462.965" title="1462.675" id=c_"1462.675">__Paul__</span> and, and Berlin and, all these artists in that I still to this day consider highly influential on my everything that I do. And so just, I guess, you know, at the time in the nineties when a lot of people were either playing techno or drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="1476.805" data-end_ts="1476.965" title="1476.805" id=c_"1476.805">__and__</span> bass and then here's this kid playing Apex twin and just stood out, you know, there weren't a lot of people playing that kinda stuff. So that was kinda one of my secrets to success. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I think actually the first time I ever saw you rather than like met you, first time I ever saw you, was you actually DJing at a little hole in the wall somewhere <span style="color:red" data-ts="1496.905" data-end_ts="1497.125" title="1496.905" id=c_"1496.905">__on__</span> Minneapolis? I had driven out to a thing. And what was interesting to me is the music you were playing was the music that I was listening to at work that everybody thought I was insane. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b><laugh> <laugh> awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But it was, it was the thing that activated me. And so I just like, I was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1516.305" data-end_ts="1516.525" title="1516.305" id=c_"1516.305">__oh__</span>, this guy's righteous. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1518.355" data-end_ts="1518.645" title="1518.355" id=c_"1518.355">__Nice__</span>. Thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, so the scene at the time was kind of interesting because like you said, the, the raves scene sort of drew in from all over the place. It drew in from people that were kind of coming to it from punk and skateboarding side of things. And you especially saw that like with the, you know, the hardcore scene and especially sort of like the angry scene coming outta Milwaukee. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1547.715" data-end_ts="1548.005" title="1547.715" id=c_"1547.715">__Yeah__</span>. And then you had sort of a, a more hip hop driven thing, which kind of came from all over the place. You had the Detroit and the Chicago scenes, all kinds of melding together. And, and a lot of people point to the old Midwest rave scene as being kind of unique in that it really blended stuff rather than being like really heavy or really blinders on in one direction. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. What do you think was, that was about, why do you think that was the case and why do you think that, why, why do you think that there was that kind of acceptance? Because, man, I'll tell you, in most cases, our society doesn't make jumps <span style="color:red" data-ts="1583.875" data-end_ts="1584.165" title="1583.875" id=c_"1583.875">__like__</span> from, skateboarding and punk to dance music or from hip hop, which is primarily, black thing to being, this more multicultural dance thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. And it's just a, it's what what helped people make that jump? Was it, was it just, I can tell you interesting drugs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Was it great dance? No, there's, there's a reason. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>There's a, there's one very acute specific reason for, I guess one answer to your question that is correct. And, for anyone listening to this down the road, we gotta give him some credit and maybe he'll be listening to this someday himself. But Woody McBride is the reason why those nineties Midwest raves had all the different styles. Woody McBride was the one who went to Cologne and, you know, Berlin, Amsterdam, you know, Rotterdam all like in 1991, you know, 1990, I mean, and even, and it was Freddie Fresh, you know, was his, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1649.555" data-end_ts="1649.845" title="1649.555" id=c_"1649.555">__with__</span> Freddie Fresh was the guy in 1988 who came back from like Japan with a 3 0 3 to Minneapolis. He was the guy, and Freddie Fresh was the, the mentor to Paul Birkin, the fellow we were talking about earlier today. And Woody McBride Paul just went into the studio and made music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And Woody went out and started throwing raves and said, Hey, here's the deal. It's not just this house music sound all night. That's not how they do it in Europe. They have massives, you know, it's not like a hundred person party around some speakers. No. It's like 3000 people out in the city streets. And the DJs are playing a lot of different styles. And Sure, indeed, in 1991, it was a lot of styles. AKA techno hard techno techno or techno <laugh>. But I mean, but it still was relatively diverse, you know, not like diversity happens nowadays in electronic music. But back then, you know, he, Woody came back and said, Hey, check out this 3 0 3. I just heard acid house. Like if you ever heard a guy called Gerald or Baby Ford from the UK from like the early nineties, it's not like acid house from Chicago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>It's like a totally different thing. It's like pop music infused with breakbeats and acid and like a lot of compression and shit. And it's, I mean, it's kind of as you know, I mean, I'm preaching to the choir, but the thing is that these, these sounds like when Woody came back and was like, Hey, I have a 3 0 3 and a 9 0 9 and like, this is what can happen now. He was, he was inclusive to drum and bass to hardcore, to regular techno, to even like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1749.675" data-end_ts="1749.965" title="1749.675" id=c_"1749.675">__like__</span> there was no such thing as deep anything, but definitely house music happened. So house, techno drum and bass hardcore, I mean, and then that's pretty much it. And then like later people started calling things trance, which was really just techno with like a melody. But like, you know, that was really extremely diverse back then. And that was one of the things that made the Midwest rave scene really special. You got to hear DJ SS or any of these big British sound system drum and bass DJs. Even the Chicago Drummond bass DJs were really, really incredibly sick DJs. Like, the best DJs in the whole rave scene were the Chicago Drummond Bass DJs, Phantom 45, this other guy, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1793.685" data-end_ts="1793.925" title="1793.685" id=c_"1793.685">__they__</span>, there's a handful of dudes that could just play like, really. And it was seeing these guys play in their nineties and never even, I know, it was really exciting. It was an exciting time. And, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, so, so you started throwing some raves and that got you more embedded in the community. Where did it go from there for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Well, how it, how it really started is I just started like DJing and I got a couple of cool, kind of like after hours residencies early on through, a partnership I had forged, I started a, well, I helped some of my buddies open a record store. And this was by the time I was about 22, 21 or 22. So maybe like around the year 97 or 90 19 97 ish, 98. Some buddies of mine were like, we're gonna drop out of college and open a record store. What do you think? Will you help us? Like, and so I jumped in and I didn't do much early on other than be like kind of a experimental music buyer. I hung out and helped like sweep and vacuum. And then I looked at their new releases every week and was like, these labels are hot order this shit <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And so that, through that I ended up getting to know all the DJs. 'cause keep in mind, this is still a time when if you were a dj, you had a bag of records period. And so when there only two record stores in town, you know, you're the new one in the block. You've, I became, I became friends with everyone. And that was, that's how I became at the time, like, best friends with DJs, like devious one who went on to become like world famous techno DJs and also Chicago and Minneapolis house music favorites like eOne, Dave Drone, Brian Gerard, our whole Minneapolis dj, bullpen or whatever you would call it, is they all were, became friends of mine. 'cause they came to the counter and I was there with their hold bags, you know, and it just was by proxy. And since I was the one playing the weird experimental shit, they even started booking me to open or close for them or to play the after parties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And through those residencies I started cutting my teeth and the decks, you know, and getting to become a really like pro dj and learned how to work the kinks out, like where to put the subwoofers, how many subs you're really gonna need to make the girls dance, et cetera. And so through that kind of evolved and, mind you, I had thrown some underground parties like in the late nineties that were a varying success. I tried it out in shit, but I never really, like, it never really took until I became the partner in the record store closer to the end of the nineties. And then through those residencies, then I started popping off some bigger spaces. And then eventually I scored like a 5,000 square foot warehouse downtown, which I hung on to for about six or seven years. That eventually became known as the Slam Factory, which is the birthright name of Slam Academy is my old like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1959.195" data-end_ts="1959.485" title="1959.195" id=c_"1959.195">__wave__</span> party warehouse space of the two thousands. It all kind of, everything 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1963.485" data-end_ts="1963.645" title="1963.485" id=c_"1963.485">__<crosstalk>__</span>. Yeah. Yeah. It all is. It all links up. So now, some of the first times that I interacted with you professionally, the first time was probably when, I met you. You were teaching at IPR, right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b><affirmative>. Good memory. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, we were doing a max workshop there. And you were, you were attending, but you were also teaching at the time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. How did you get involved with them? I mean, 'cause they're, you know, at that point you had already graduated a point of being a teacher. And then the other question I have that may be related is at what point did you move from being a DJ to being a producer, doing someone, being someone that where you're, you're doing your own tracks instead of twisting other people's tracks? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yeah. Good questions. So to kind of add more puzzle pieces to the whole kind of lineage here. After I was a partner in the record store for a while, and became good friends with all the DJs and kind of more embedded in that community, one of my old original music mentors, a guy by the name of Jack Robinson, who was a live sound engineer for Prince and also a bass player in many funk bands from the eighties in Minneapolis, reached out to me and he said, Hey man, you took some private lessons for me back in the day. I always thought you really had a lot of talent. Like maybe you should come down and check out this school. I just opened up called IPR. And so I was, you know, I had taken some private lessons in learning how to use the M PC 2000 and, you know, ASR 10 sampler and stuff, these basic hardware devices from before computers were very popular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And you know, I was like, I just really wanna understand sound. He always used to tell me, you gotta go to school for audio. You're gonna really, you don't just wanna make house music or hip hop. You want to go to school for audio. So then, you know, fast forward years later, he calls me up and I was ready to take a break from the record store. So I cashed in my chips at the record store Final Scratch, and CDJs had just become big and our vinyl inventory was dilapidating in value. And so I backed off from that and went in and jumped into school at IPR. And I was one of the first graduating classes from the school that's downtown in Minneapolis called IPR. That's an audio engineering school. It's basically the quintessential two year associate's degree program that's extremely expensive and is, has to place you into a job that, an industry that doesn't have a lot of jobs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And so it's kind of dark to bring it back to that. So now we're starting to connect those elements. So I leave Vital vinyl, I go to college and by the time I'm ready to graduate as valedictorian, I sat down with the owners of the school and said, Hey guys, in many ways this was bullshit. And they respected me enough 'cause I did great in school and all the teachers <span style="color:red" data-ts="2125.565" data-end_ts="2125.805" title="2125.565" id=c_"2125.565">__loved__</span> me. So they sat down with me and I was like, I touched one Moog synth once. I never saw a drum machine. I never saw a teacher that knew how to rock a drum machine or a synthesizer. And I paid this much money. And like when I came to you guys, I was an owner of a record store. I was a DJ and I wanted to learn how to produce dance music, electronic tracks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>I did not wanna record bands and I did not wanna learn how to, get a job at a Pizza Hutt or whatever. So, 'cause I already had a career a little bit. And so because of that, I already having a career background, they were able to sneak me in as a teacher. They offered me a gig as a, they said, okay, can you help us with this? 'cause we don't know how to do that. You have industry experience being a dj. Maybe you can write a DJ class for us. So I wrote a couple classes and guess what? His name comes up again. Paul Birkin, my hero at the time. I was like, yeah, I can write a class in electronic music, but you're gonna have to let me hire my hero. And so they let me hire Paul Burkin. And at the time it seemed like a lot of money I gave him, which was nothing relatively at the time, but a stipend to come and help. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And after about six months, he was like, jp, you got this. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2190.685" data-end_ts="2190.805" title="2190.685" id=c_"2190.685">__I__</span>, order up 45 copies of Ableton Live, version two and, or three, right when it was, right when three came out. And I got a call from Germany about a week later and they're like, nobody has ever ordered 45 copies of this. We're in version three. We just started. Who are you? So I was like, yeah, I'm from Minneapolis. Have you ever heard of Prince? Check out these studios. We have this, you know, <laugh>. And I was just, at the time I felt like some kid that had stumbled onto some like secret magical connection between Germany and Minneapolis. And I felt like, I was like, oh my God, I'm on some. So I, I sent <span style="color:red" data-ts="2223.685" data-end_ts="2223.805" title="2223.685" id=c_"2223.685">__him__</span> my curriculums, they helped, gave me tips and feedback and, came and stayed with me for a while and I showed them how bullshit the pro <span style="color:red" data-ts="2230.205" data-end_ts="2230.405" title="2230.205" id=c_"2230.205">__tool__</span> certification world was and Apple certifications and how all that was just a big hustle and I didn't agree with it. And, so I got to play a role in developing the Ableton certified trainer program and became the first stateside Ableton certified trainer. Cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Yep. Very interesting. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>A lot of puzzle pieces, but it kind of like the executive summary is, it goes DJing, record store residencies and gigs, throwing parties, going back to school, valedictorian, getting the gig to teach, establishing the connection with Ableton, becoming the first certified trainer, leaving those schools, working for Dubs <span style="color:red" data-ts="2269.525" data-end_ts="2269.645" title="2269.525" id=c_"2269.525">__Spot__</span> for five years in New York, which was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2271.125" data-end_ts="2271.245" title="2271.125" id=c_"2271.125">__an__</span> overall good experience. And then starting Slam Academy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I didn't know you'd worked at <span style="color:red" data-ts="2276.145" data-end_ts="2276.365" title="2276.145" id=c_"2276.145">__Dub__</span> Dubs <span style="color:red" data-ts="2277.205" data-end_ts="2277.285" title="2277.205" id=c_"2277.205">__spot__</span>. Did you actually, were you there or were you developing remotely? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>I, helped develop a bunch of curriculum including their, lackluster sound design program. Sorry, I just have to say it. It's, it's just was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2289.805" data-end_ts="2289.925" title="2289.805" id=c_"2289.805">__a__</span>, it wasn't what I wanted it to become. And so it was, yeah. But their students are great. But, that ended up not working out for a variety of reasons. I didn't go to New York except for just to do special gigs or shoot special videos. I did do a ton of teaching for them, so I developed a lot of positive relationships with a lot of great students from Dubs, Spott. So that was awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now the other thing, the other place where I interacted with you professionally, maybe it wasn't a paid profession, but it was a thing, was your work as, sort of your involvement in the Spark Festival. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which was, for a while there, which was to me the, crown jewel of Minneapolis. I loved coming up. I loved performing here. I actually did my best performance ever. Nice. With with part of, with Gregory Taylor and those guys. The, the night that all the transformers blew out downtown. And we played a, we played a candlelight gig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>That's right. Yeah. Oh dude, I forgot that was upstairs in the church. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>You used the modular right? And you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2361.005" data-end_ts="2361.085" title="2361.005" id=c_"2361.005">__did__</span> algorithm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes, that was, that was, that was the first time I performed live with the modular 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Algorithmic drop sequencing with Max 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. It was crazy cool. It was, it was something else. And it was, it was an amazing experience because, you know, it was, since all the electricity was wiped out, you guys quickly pulled together a generator and we were literally the only thing making sound for <laugh> square miles. It was awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b><laugh> and the candlelight and the sound system, it's like we only have four so many plugins that's gotta go to the speaker. Don't turn any lights on. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And it was in a church. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it was in a church. It was hilarious. It was, it was special. But what was, how did you get involved with that? That Doug <span style="color:red" data-ts="2402.045" data-end_ts="2402.365" title="2402.045" id=c_"2402.045">__Gears__</span> was running that right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yeah, sure was. Yep, Doug. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so how did you get involved with him? 'cause he was kind of doing that based outta him being a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2412.325" data-end_ts="2412.445" title="2412.325" id=c_"2412.325">__a__</span> U of M, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yeah, so, the University of Minnesota entirely due to the fact that Doug <span style="color:red" data-ts="2419.205" data-end_ts="2419.485" title="2419.205" id=c_"2419.205">__Gears__</span> was working there as the head of their electronic music department, which was barely a department, I'm sure he will admit it was just him. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2427.545" data-end_ts="2427.765" title="2427.545" id=c_"2427.545">__it__</span> didn't even have a lot of, it's just, it was academic electronic music, unfortunately. So he was wedged up against the classical music, right? World 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Establishment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2440.145" data-end_ts="2440.365" title="2440.145" id=c_"2440.145">__Oh__</span> no. This dynamic. So, so eventually he left, which was really in the end, the reason why this Spark Festival went to shit. Unfortunately he got married, God bless him, he moved to the East Eastern Europe or something and he's doing great and very happy and we all love him. But the festival got handed off to a variety of other real kind of directors who didn't end up having their heart in the right place in the way that we envisioned one way or the other. But, the reason why I got involved with that was because just from my experience DJing and going to school for music and stuff and just being kind of a community person, the Spark Festival was an academic music festival and they went a year or two without me. And it was an academic electronic music festival. It was in the daytime. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>The majority of the project programming was in classrooms and they had people writing and reading papers and, you know, it was a true academic festival. And there's nothing wrong with paper sessions and there's nothing wrong with, intellectualization of creative concepts. 'cause I appreciate that a lot. But the festival was entirely that for the most part and a tiny bit of tape music, because, you know, that's what electronic music is, right? If it's prerecorded it's tape music, period. So no, so that was, I mean, systemically the thing was flawed. But, so after two years, then Dr. J Allen, my partner here who I mentioned earlier, who was like the president of the electronic music club at the U of M, 'cause he was finishing his PhD at the U at the time, said to the u you guys are bogus. There's this whole world of real electronic music that you guys need to tap into where this festival sucks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And I'm sure he said that to Doug years probably over a beer. And Doug was like, bye job. And so they, they <laugh> so they, threw their social connections, reached out to the big rave promoter in town and convinced him to work for the U of M and become their curator for their nightlife department. So Jay reached out to me. And the funny thing is now, I mean, fast forward to the end of the story, after seven years of cur co-curating the Spark Festival and getting to know amazing people like you, Gregory Taylor, et cetera, you know, the crew that you and I had known love so well, our friends who I'm, I all consider mutual friends at this point. So for me, those times were really great in my memory too. Thanks for saying those nice things about it. It was a lot of work, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>But then after that disbanded a couple years later, J Allen reached out to me and said, Hey, I still wanna work with you. I love doing Spark with you. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2584.945" data-end_ts="2585.165" title="2584.945" id=c_"2584.945">__So__</span> one of the only nice things he's ever said to me, and, <laugh> <laugh>, he's just, he's a pretty dry character. You know, it's 10 years later I'm still waiting for that next like, Hey, nice shirt, <laugh> or whatever. I got a few more years I think. But, that's why we're so good together. 'cause I'm totally feel, I'm totally feels mode all the time. And he's totally just like brass tack mode all the time. So <laugh> awesome. Yeah. But, so that's how, so Slam Academy, that's how Slam Academy gets started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very cool. So, <laugh>,

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's, no, but it's, it's actually kind of, it is the kind of way stuff goes. Because the fact of the matter is this whole industry and this whole world that we inhabit the whole media artist world, it was never planned. This hasn't followed, this isn't followed the blueprint of an artistic study or an artistic movement. This has been total, this combination of what does it take to get your rocks off and what does it take to be able to do it the next day? You know, and it's, and so it's not planned, but in that way I think it really brings out a different kind of creativity. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and I actually, I kind of appreciate that, really. So now for yourself, you, you say now that you're doing, you, you're like the con content guru at Slam Academy. What does, what does that mean? What does it really look like? So for you to put together a program Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, do you, is it like one program that's gonna last six months? Or do you do like mini segments and how do you, how do you establish that? What's the process you go through to develop a program? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Well the, I guess it's a little tiny bit more backstory. Zooming in a little closer. Okay. So Slam Academy started and our original idea was like, okay, how are we gonna convince people that they wanna spend money on learning how to like do this? And so that we were really trying to like get our feet wet in the market with the lowest price point possible. So we were kicking off glasses for like a hundred bucks, 150 bucks, like, please God, just like come down for a couple nights, you know? And it became a, a marketing rat race. 'cause we had very little money and we were chasing down new names every two or three weeks. I mean, like, you're spending all your human resource energy just trying to find new people. 'cause no matter how much they love the program, they're on their way out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And not only that, but I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2742.405" data-end_ts="2742.485" title="2742.405" id=c_"2742.405">__mean__</span>, let's be honest, if you wanna teach someone something beyond, just like follow these five clicks, voila. But actually some deeper under the hood meta conceptual stuff, like we were talking about earlier, six months is a challenge, you know, let alone three weeks. So because of the nature of the content and also just the nature of us wanting to spend more time teaching and not just like trying to find new people with, because we never took out a loan <laugh>, you know, so we were just doing this on elbow grease and for the love, you know, and when somebody enrolls, we're like, oh my God, we might be able to like buy a coffee for the coffee maker next month. So, I mean, especially in the beginning, that's kind of how it was. And so the short class format though became just too exhausting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>And so one way or the other and not effective enough. And so we were like, you know what, let's take Ableton 1, 2, 3, and four and the mixing and mastering class, which are all two or three weeks long, and let's slam 'em all together into one big mega Ableton program or music production program using Ableton Live. And, like I said, stars aligned. I mean, electronic music is in this beautiful state and every single 18-year-old, or 19-year-old right now has at least been to a party with electronic music and thinks it's cool if not like, played on some turntables or CDJs, if not played around with Fruity Loops or Garage Band, or possibly even Ableton Live. I mean, that's like, it's everywhere now. And so like the hooks are already out there, like it's organically selling itself. And so as far as the inside of writing a program, so a normal program is six months long, and that's 24 weeks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Each week has three to five lessons, and each lesson has three to five concepts. Each concept has a demonstration. So I mean, the spreadsheet keeping track of this a six month program is, it's 600 cells. So I mean it's, it's 400 videos to make this into an online class. I mean, which is scary, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah. And so, so I'm sure a lot of them are really short, like three or four <span style="color:red" data-ts="2863.545" data-end_ts="2863.765" title="2863.545" id=c_"2863.545">__or__</span> five, six minutes. But, you know, we've came up with this format, you know, and I, and we're still, I still get people saying maybe they should be three months long, or maybe they should be a year long. And I'm like, look, you know, this after be, after teaching at Debs <span style="color:red" data-ts="2879.005" data-end_ts="2879.125" title="2879.005" id=c_"2879.005">__spot__</span> and seeing what it works at other places and also working at IPR for 10 years plus seeing people who finally get to this elective, it's like, you need more time than just a few months, or, you know, even a few weeks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>You need six months. This is what it came to. So what I really have distilled every single concept and every single lesson plan down from, is from those first sessions with Paul Burkin at IPR like 15 years ago where we were like, how do you teach someone how to make electronic music? And he said, the first thing you do is you hit play. So you hit the space bar or whatever, and you get a couple sounds going, and then it's just like organically starts flowing from there. And I've gleaned a lot of great tips from master producers and engineers I've worked with in the past as well as, really forward thinking experimental electronic musicians, not unlike yourself, Greg Retailer, Christopher Petty in New York at Dubs, Spott, other people who have really shown me the light as far as the deeper meaning behind, wow, this can all be interconnected and how it can bring a greater sense of just the life experience to anyone who chooses to carve out the time in their daylight hours, you know, or nighttime hours I guess as it were. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So it's interesting that hit play is sort of like the, the launch point because to, to a certain extent that really preferences one of two things. Either Ableton live because the way that it works or hardware because of the way that that works, right? To what extent is all of what you're doing, sort of like prefaced on the idea of what Ableton Live brought, I mean, to what extent was that the enabling technology that made this all kind of happen for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Well, to, I'd say honestly, to make sure to be recognizing and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2982.345" data-end_ts="2982.565" title="2982.345" id=c_"2982.345">__opt__</span> maximum humility here, I'd say that it played a huge role, in the overall flow of events in my life because, you know, when you were working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2993.885" data-end_ts="2994.005" title="2993.885" id=c_"2993.885">__a__</span> a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2995.025" data-end_ts="2995.245" title="2995.025" id=c_"2995.025">__Kai__</span> MS 2000 and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2996.645" data-end_ts="2996.765" title="2996.645" id=c_"2996.645">__a__</span>, a SR 10 sampler, you couldn't just tell someone to press play <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There was <span style="color:red" data-ts="3002.125" data-end_ts="3002.285" title="3002.125" id=c_"3002.125">__no__</span> bear there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>I mean, and even if you hit the play button, like, what, what does this mean? You know what I mean? There's a lot to know under the hood and Ableton live and computer technology in general, but the really intuitive interface design of live, enabled me as somebody who was not Doug <span style="color:red" data-ts="3020.965" data-end_ts="3021.245" title="3020.965" id=c_"3020.965">__Gears__</span> or Dr. J Allen to be like, Hey, I know how to DJ and rock a party and I know how to, like, I played video games when I was a kid and I love music. I think I can make this happen. You know, in the years of DJ experience from owning thousands of records that I loved and getting, you know, that helped a lot too. A little survey of the landscape before taking a crack at it myself, which I think was kind of a hidden ingredient that I had that other people who loved music didn't have, you know, gotta go out there and listen to stuff, you know. But yeah, the, the intuitiveness of the interface and how you can now with Ableton Live, once you know how to install a program, you know, you can hit space bar, right? And if you plug your headphones in, I mean, the transport's rolling <laugh>, you know, and so you all of a sudden with a couple clicks are right in the middle of a powerhouse studio that is not unlike playing video games. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So now it, it sounds to me like not only for your own work, but certainly with your students, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3080.465" data-end_ts="3080.685" title="3080.465" id=c_"3080.465">__the__</span>, you know, kind of focusing on Ableton Live is, is a good common denominator. It's something that everyone can wrap their arms around. It's sort of like the lingua franca, and as a result you can teach and they can follow because they can get the shit you have, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do you make the leap to hardware where all of a sudden you're like, everyone's modular synth is completely different, or I got a 3 0 3, you're never gonna find one Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, or I use a, I use a Juno two because I just really like that Hoover sound that can't be emulated and, you don't, you know, I live off of that sound. You may not too bad for you. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3124.685" data-end_ts="3124.725" title="3124.685" id=c_"3124.685">__<affirmative>__</span> how do you make the leap of saying, because I assume that with, you know, whether it's the sound production or sound design or whatever, you eventually push people beyond a common set of tools. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yeah. You know, that's a good question. I mean, I, I, to bring it back to the intuitive nature of the live interface, it just begs itself to get outside of the box. I mean, I, I don't think it's really about any sort of, I'm old and grew up around machines kind of shit. Not really, because I mean, nowadays even the machines I use are just one USB cable. You don't have to have some sort of like, deep understanding of control voltage, right? I mean, so I feel like the leap was, was kind of easy, you know? The MIDI controller world, you know, even in the early two thousands was already blown up with companies like <span style="color:red" data-ts="3169.545" data-end_ts="3169.765" title="3169.545" id=c_"3169.545">__de__</span> defer and fader <span style="color:red" data-ts="3171.265" data-end_ts="3171.485" title="3171.265" id=c_"3171.265">__fox__</span> and, you know, indie like, then later on, later on, like livid and out of Austin, you know, like taking the MIDI controller world and being like, Hey, it's not just, it's not just some black and white keys in a mod wheel. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Guys, we can do more with this. You know, nowadays with the analog resurgence all around the world, I mean, even beyond just the modular, but look at semi modular or just tabletop hardware devices, right? They're huge. You know, like the advanced shit, like electron is like mind blowing. You know what I mean? All the shit that those things can do. And then if you look at the more simple stuff like the Roland IRA line or, you know, the ULCA series, I mean, this shit is like toys and integrating it with live is so easy and it just, if there's, you know, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Are you able to, are you able to teach that stuff though? I mean, how do you, in an environment where you're teaching a group of people can do, you have the flexibility of saying, all right, everyone go out and get a vuca, you know, not really, but so how do not really, you, how do you help the students embrace what is now becoming a very much a hybrid environment where hardware and software commingles all the time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3240.085" data-end_ts="3240.205" title="3240.085" id=c_"3240.085">__I__</span>, my, my best possible answer. 'cause that is a great question and it's a tough one to answer. 'cause certainly you can't just be like, we're gonna teach a six month class and you know, this kind of hardware where pss you have to go spend a bunch of money on all this hardware and build a studio, right? Like that's a, that's, prohibit prohibitively difficult, you know? But yeah. So, it's, it's easier to make it accessible for folks now that the machines are more accessible and easier to integrate and more simple, you know? But to tell you the truth, the way that I do it is another element, secret ingredient to helping slam academies offerings, clearly standalone from like a YouTube university type situation is because we teach, okay, this is now getting at the heart and soul of what makes, what I'm doing special is that I've learned that you can teach from the top down or the bottom up, but the best lesson plans connect the top down recipes and formulas to the bottom up concepts through exercises. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>So there's this, like, the exercise and the hands <span style="color:red" data-ts="3305.385" data-end_ts="3305.605" title="3305.385" id=c_"3305.385">__on__</span> time is when you learn. And what you're doing then is you're taking your bottom <span style="color:red" data-ts="3309.025" data-end_ts="3309.245" title="3309.025" id=c_"3309.025">__up__</span> conceptual understanding and you're associating it with top down results. And so teaching the bottom up stuff is the stuff that you can't get on YouTube. It's like you can maybe find a video about the Harmonic series or about, analog distortion or rectification or, you know, things like these conceptual things or like oscillator sync. I mean, you can find videos kind of about this, but you're gonna find a shitload more videos about how to make that skrill X baseline, you know, and that's top down. But when you can manage to keep the students interested enough to where they're willing to sit through a demonstration about what oscillator syn is, really when they walk away with the lab exercise, which is like, make that Hoover sound by putting a pitch envelope on the, the slave oscillator and sinking it to an inaudible oscillator, now you get <span style="color:red" data-ts="3363.275" data-end_ts="3363.565" title="3363.275" id=c_"3363.275">__well__</span> and it's like, oh, okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Bam. Now it doesn't matter if I have a, if I'm running massive or serum or if I have a ULCA or a roll into IRA or even an electron, I'm gonna find that sync button and I'm gonna figure out how to make it, how to engage it and offset its frequency from the master or from the slave, you know? And like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3384.445" data-end_ts="3384.645" title="3384.445" id=c_"3384.445">__and__</span> get that, you know. So bottom up conceptualization of the core elements underlying, beneath each lesson plan's, top <span style="color:red" data-ts="3392.765" data-end_ts="3393.005" title="3392.765" id=c_"3392.765">__down__</span> results formula is the, the secret to a successful lesson plan strategy nowadays. And that can hopefully, that can maybe empower me to be able to teach like analog modular synthesis for six months to a bunch of people who all have their own urac, right? Or maybe even don't have one, but just have some plugins. Like you can have a Arturia Mogue Modular v and a Madrona Labs Alto or Chivo, and I mean, dude, you can patch the living shit out of your, you know, you can patch yourself to your blue in the face with those few simple, affordable plugins. And a lot of people just wanna work in that environment. So I'm really striving to be able to teach these things to people like, and keep it kind of somewhat hardware ambiguous through the bottom up conceptualization that we all know is connecting all these dots anyway, might as well help people understand that and then empower them to just become artists on the level that they hope to, and not just be tethered to one device or machine, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's a fantastic vision. I really love it. Thanks. But now I am going to hearken back to earlier in our conversation and try and put you on the spot a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Good. Do it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3464.965" data-end_ts="3465.245" title="3464.965" id=c_"3464.965">__right__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> Good. Do it. He says let's do it. Because we're getting close, I've already blown past my time. I apologize for taking <span style="color:red" data-ts="3471.905" data-end_ts="3472.125" title="3471.905" id=c_"3471.905">__to__</span> too much of your time, but, I really want to, I want to ask you one more thing. When you talk about IPR or you talk about some of these other things, you talk about the end game being, you know, they have to try and help you find placement because they just had you write 'em a lot of money in checks. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and now it's their responsibility to place you. So somebody comes out of one of your programs, or maybe, I mean, first of all, do you do things where it's like, okay, you do the, the production program and then you're gonna naturally want to try the sound design program. Is there that kind of like chaining of programs? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yep, yep. It goes DJ production, sound design, mixing and mastering. I see. Okay. That's kind of the general track. Some people take DJing last if they're already just keen to production, but Right. The DJ program ideally feeds the production program. 'cause every DJ wants to play their own tunes. Right? Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So what is, what is the carrot that you hold out as the end game other than sort of like the zen-like, appreciation of your own shit? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, what is it that you can help people? How do you, first of all, how do you give them a vision for what they can be? 'cause quite frankly, I think we live in an amazing time where there are opportunities that are being made up whole cloth every day. There's shit that's a job right now that didn't exist two weeks ago. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yep. For sure. For sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so much of this stuff is tied to, is tied to artistry and being skilled with tools and having depth rather than a shallow knowledge, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3571.605" data-end_ts="3571.725" title="3571.605" id=c_"3571.605">__Yeah__</span>. So I think all these things are important, but how do you have, how can you hold out some sort of, I say carrot, but maybe what I'm actually at looking for is a vision for where people go to where they're not working at Pizza Hutt and then coming home and doing tracks, but maybe they find a more creative way. Because there's two things. There's like, or three things actually. There's like the skill. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. There's like some Ill-defined. Make a connection. Make a network kind of a thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. There's also the self-confidence to go out and say, I got my shit together. Hire me. Or, Mm-Hmm <affirmative>, I got my shit together. Let's collaborate on something amazing or whatever. How do you help people get to there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yeah. I tell you what, I, before answering that, have to just say that there's no promises made ever beyond self-realization in the Slam Academy game. Self-realization on the psychological and emotional level, but also just if your vision to realize is to put out music that people are listening to, we're gonna help you do that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3646.785" data-end_ts="3647.005" title="3646.785" id=c_"3646.785">__The__</span>, it's the tangibility of like paycheck related feedback is something that as a company we plead the fifth 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, but rightly so, because I think to do anything less would be just bullshit 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Because I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="3662.645" data-end_ts="3662.765" title="3662.645" id=c_"3662.645">__wanna__</span> be unethical. Right? Right. You know? 'cause I can tell you that, I wanted to DJ and I stayed true to it. And it's all that I did for almost 20 years. And through being true to that, I started a record store that became successful. I got a degree in audio. I became a teacher. I curated an international festival for seven years. I, et cetera, all those other things eventually like became a successful school owner, gallery owner, all byproducts of me being 17 and being like, no, I believe that I am an artist. So I don't believe probably anyone else will go out and follow that path. 'cause that is a crazy fucking path. <laugh>. But you know what? But when you do something that you love and stay true to it for long enough, even without the master's degree, someone someday is gonna ask you for advice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>You know, I have become a shaman and a music doctor for people all day long. And it's not because of anything that's really that tangible other than my own relationship with the arts and my respect for it, my humility for it and my respect for other people's time and their vision to do something unique. I am just, you know, through getting down to cutting away the bullshit and getting down to like the oneness element that we all share, I feel like I'm showing people a path to great inner peace and joy that will then extrapolate maybe into probably some sort of career where you find happiness. And the chances of it involving audio are pretty high. Because when you finish one of our programs, you understand audio on a way deeper level than if you spent six months at IPR or YouTube University, right. And either of the two scopes, you know, 50,000 a year or the free we're like way closer to free. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>But giving you more of a holistic offering, including all those things, it's gonna, you know, again, it might not be till you're 35 or 40 and you might be 18 going to Slam Academy, but hey, enjoy that path. Right? You know, I worked at coffee shops and bike shops, but you know what? I love biking and I love coffee. So that was cool. <laugh>, you know, and now I'm 40 and I probably don't have as much money as somebody that, you know, went to a career college and got placed in the ultimate position by their placement department. But that's a really low percentage of those kids that go and sign up on that tuition that is non-refundable. Whether or not you get placement, you know what I'm saying? Right. So, so yeah. I mean, we're trying to strike the happy medium here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The fact that it's honest is, is actually that's cool. That's, that's, I appreciate it. Not only because it's real, but it actually also sort of like speaks to what I know of you, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I mean, somehow it seems like an honest expression of who you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>It is not somehow because it is, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, that's, that's awesome. Well, JP, I, I wish I could talk to you for another three hours 'cause I got three hours more of questions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>I know I got three more hours more of answers, but I too have got to jet <span style="color:red" data-ts="3861.865" data-end_ts="3862.085" title="3861.865" id=c_"3861.865">__and__</span> unfortunately, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, let's get together and do this again. But thank you so much for your time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Yeah. Thanks to anyone who's been listening this long and, my email address is jp@slamacademy.com and if you have any questions about any of the crazy stuff you just heard or anything else regarding music, don't hesitate to email me and just mention Darwin Gross podcast and the subject line. I'll make sure to get it to it as soon as I can. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. Thank you so much jp. A great 
</p>

<p>
<b>James: </b>Day. Thanks <span style="color:red" data-ts="3891.285" data-end_ts="3891.445" title="3891.285" id=c_"3891.285">__sir__</span>. For sure. Will do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to JP for the great talk for hearing a little bit about his background and about his background growing up with the Midwest rave scene, but also his views on education and how to be inspired. It's very interesting stuff, very appreciative of him taking the time to talk to me about it. And I appreciate your time listening, interacting with me, sending your ideas. I really appreciate 'em all. Keep 'em coming. My email is ddg@cyclingseventyfour.com. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Next week I'm gonna be taking a break. I need a week off in order to get some personal stuff done. So I'll be seeing you in two weeks. And with that, have a great time and.
