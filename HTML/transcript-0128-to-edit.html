<b>Darwin: </b>All right, this week I have the opportunity to talk to <span style="color:red" data-ts="16.915" data-end_ts="17.205" title="16.915" id=c_"16.915">__some__</span>, to basically make a new friend. And, you're gonna get to listen in on it. His name is Ben Ho. He works, with Matthew Davidson over at Berkeley, but he also has a pretty varied and interesting art life. And so what we're going to do is talk to him, explore his background, and, get to know a little bit more about Ben. So let's start off by saying hi. Hi, Ben. How are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben Houge: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="43.385" data-end_ts="43.605" title="43.385" id=c_"43.385">__Oh__</span>, I'm great. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. Thanks a lot for taking time outta your schedule. I know that you're a busy guy. I appreciate you taking the time to talk with us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Sure. It's my pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's kick off by having you tell, me and the listeners a little bit about your work, your life, and work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Sure. Well, it's kind of very negated, I suppose, but my main thing these days is I'm working with chefs and creating music for dining experiences. That's been something that's, it's been a concern of mine for probably about 10 years. I really kicked it into high gear the last couple of years, with a series of events, that I call, I call them food operas, which is, which sometimes perplexes people because singing isn't really the main focus, and a lot of people think of opera and they think of singing. But the, the idea that I was sort of trying to get at is the idea of putting things together. You know, operas being one of the most multimedia things that we have in terms of art forms. And so I wanted to draw attention to the fact that I'm putting music <span style="color:red" data-ts="110.005" data-end_ts="110.205" title="110.005" id=c_"110.005">__and__</span> food together, and sort of highlight that sort of not so common connection. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And the, the, the angle that I'm coming from with this is actually very much from my background in, well, originally classical <span style="color:red" data-ts="127.855" data-end_ts="128.205" title="127.855" id=c_"127.855">__study__</span>, classical music, well pop running pop songs before that. And, but most of my career has been in the video game field. So I'm actually treating the challenge of scoring a meal as kind of like a video game problem in that you're responding to real <span style="color:red" data-ts="142.685" data-end_ts="142.885" title="142.685" id=c_"142.685">__time__</span> events, and there's a lot of indeterminacy built into that sort of setting where you don't know what somebody's going to order or when the dish is going to arrive, or how long they're going to take to eat it. So I'm building real time responsive music systems that can accompany the unpredictable events of the dining room. And in the process of doing that, I've been exploring the world of, multisensory or crossmodal psychology, which is a growing field of research where people are looking at how the sense of sound affects your sense of taste, and also thinking of the meal as kind of a time-based art form. And, and getting into also some sort of ethnographic practices and trying to use sound to bring people closer to the, to the farms that are providing the ingredients. So that's not a very succinct introduction, but that's, those are some of the things that I'm thinking about these days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, I, I don't know that I needed it succinct. I, but the concept is pretty amazing, and it leads to like about a hundred questions right off the get go. So what you're doing is you're not, I just happen to listen to a podcast that Mark Marin did, and he was talking to a guy where they do this. There was some study where they were doing a pairing of like, foods and, and sounds You're not doing that, you're literally like scoring the experience of eating the meal. Is that correct? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>It, which touches on the former thing that you mentioned as well. But, but yeah, it's, it's, it's sort of, taking a big picture, kind of dramatic narrative approach to it, but embracing it as a, also a kind of a, a narrative that has non-linear elements to it as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. Well, that sounds, that sounds really interesting. How do you find people who want to do this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="255.685" data-end_ts="255.905" title="255.685" id=c_"255.685">__It__</span>, there are a couple of different answers to that. I've done different projects sort of on different scales. So the sort of the first large scale event that we did was through, we did it at Harvard's Graduate School of Design. I'm here in Cambridge, Massachusetts, so they're just up the road. There was a, a series that was looking at food and design that was going on there, and I was asked to be involved. And through that we were put in touch with a, very active and innovative chef here in the Boston area named Jason Bond. He's got a restaurant called Bond <span style="color:red" data-ts="294.345" data-end_ts="294.545" title="294.345" id=c_"294.345">__Deer__</span>, very well-regarded place. And he does really innovative things, very committed to just whatever's fresh that day. He writes his menus that day based on what's available and, and, works a lot with local farmers. And, and he's done a lot of stuff with Harvard's Science and Cooking lecture series, which is a, a series that they run every fall in conjunction with the class that they teach in the science department. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>But the lectures are open to the public. And so I think through his involvement with that series where they, I mean, it's a fantastic series and it's, it's mostly recorded. I think it's available if you search for it on YouTube. Most of the public lectures when they bring in some of the leading figures in the culinary world, and they sort of suss out the science and what they're doing as well, usually they use it to talk about, you know, soft, matter and, and things like that. How, you know, gels and suspensions and, aeration and diffusion and all kinds of interesting things like that. And, so through his involvement in that, we got put in touch, and then he was just very up for the idea. So we did one event at the design school here, graduate School of Design, and then we did two subsequent events at his restaurant here in, in Cambridge. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And now he has a second restaurant out in Concord. And then, so those are the first kind of the big first three events that we did. The first one was in 2012. And, and then I've done a number of other events in just a range of different venues. The the thing that I was actually just, I just, was composing up until 15 minutes ago is a project that I'm doing with a new music ensemble in St. Paul, Minnesota called Zeitgeist, a venerable institution in the Twin Cities new music scene. Been around for a long time. And so I'm writing a project for them, St. Paul Food Opera. And, we're gonna collaborate with a number of different chefs. And so that's been one where the, where Heather <span style="color:red" data-ts="407.715" data-end_ts="408.205" title="407.715" id=c_"407.715">__Brander__</span>, who's the director of that ensemble, has been doing a legwork since I'm not currently in Minnesota, working with the chefs. And so that's gonna be, we're gonna do, we've done a couple of sort of public workshops, one last summer and one last, I guess it was January when I was out there, just sort of, presenting the idea, giving people a little taste of the idea. And we're gonna do another one here at the end of the month and then, do a, a larger scale event in October in St. Paul. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, the work that, the work that's played, is it classical instrumentation? Is it Costo electric or is it electronic? Or what, what is the, what is the ensemble that plays this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Well, it could be anything because one of the, one of my key considerations with this is, so this was sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="463.085" data-end_ts="463.245" title="463.085" id=c_"463.085">__the__</span>, the original spark for the idea <span style="color:red" data-ts="464.285" data-end_ts="464.405" title="464.285" id=c_"464.285">__of__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="464.405" data-end_ts="464.445" title="464.405" id=c_"464.405">__the__</span> sort of epiphany was the idea that I was, so at the time I was working for the French video game developer, Ubisoft. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And they're, so they're based in headquartered in Paris. They have offices all over the world. Their largest development studio is in Montreal. And I was working at their second largest development studio, at least at the time. I'm not sure if it still is in Shanghai. <span style="color:red" data-ts="486.435" data-end_ts="486.725" title="486.435" id=c_"486.435">__Okay__</span>. So I was living in China for six years, went over, moved over there in 2004 to take this job with Ubisoft. So I was heading up audio for, it was a game called Tom Clancy's End War. <span style="color:red" data-ts="498.265" data-end_ts="498.485" title="498.265" id=c_"498.265">__It__</span> was in the Tom Clancy universe of Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>You know, splinter Cell Ghost Recon Rainbow Six, and Right. So I was the audio director on that project, and I was devising a music system that would respond to the, the unpredictable way that the game might unfold. And this was a real <span style="color:red" data-ts="516.085" data-end_ts="516.245" title="516.085" id=c_"516.085">__time__</span> strategy game in the Tom Clancy universe, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="518.795" data-end_ts="519.085" title="518.795" id=c_"518.795">__that__</span> was, there was previous games where, you know, like stealth or, third person games or, or first person shooters or whatever. So, this was a different kind of approach with, with a particularly large amount of replayability to it, because the game could go a lot of different directions depending on your strategy, the strategy of your opponent. And so there were a lot more variables than in the other Tom Clancy game. So I was devising, I was working hard to devise a particularly responsive music system, and I was at a, at a restaurant in Shanghai with a, was a French chef guy named <span style="color:red" data-ts="555.995" data-end_ts="556.285" title="555.995" id=c_"555.995">__Paul__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="556.395" data-end_ts="556.685" title="556.395" id=c_"556.395">__Pere__</span>, who's, was my favorite chef while I was living there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And he, it was just a really innovative meal that combined all kinds of unexpected things. It was like, candied fo gras on a stick and, sardine foam in a can. And, you know, a lemon when you, when you open it up, there's ice cream inside. And just really fun, playful, unexpected things. And, sort of, I thought, well, you know, we could, the the techniques that I'm developing for this video game could just as easily be applied to this dining room. Sure. And, and at the same time, the feeling that I got from the food was, it was that sense of sort of, having to really engage your senses because the food was so weird. It didn't give me a, I didn't have a lot to, of context to draw on. I had really Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, of course. Like a Thanksgiving dinner, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>For example. Exactly. Or a barbecue or Right. Caesar salad, you know? Yeah. So, and I, and I found that very pleasurable because in my mind it was very similar to what I like when I go to a concert of new music that I feel like I really need to pay attention and listen and see what is this connected to? 'cause I don't have that context just handed to me. So those are sort of the twins observations. The idea of the, the meal was kind of like a time-based art form, kind of like a new music concert, and then the idea that these, this video game music system could be used to solve the problems of scoring, a meal because of the indeterminacy inherent in the, in the sort of format. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That sounds really, that sounds really interesting. And it's, it's interesting that you would make the leap from, the video game to, to this food, food context. Although, you know, really the way that you were just talking about this Tom Clancy game really does sound like what happens when you're really around, a great chef, which is that even if they do something similar there, there happens to be a Thai restaurant that I like going to here Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And oftentimes I'll order the same thing, but oftentimes it'll either be a change in the ambience or a change in the wine that I, that I have with the food. Or if I have a beer, the beer that I have with the food, or some change in the spices that are used that day or whatever. It's, it's got that replayability, you know, it's not eating the same meal Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because it's not the same experience. And that's, that's really interesting that you would've made, that, made that connection. That's pretty cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. And that, that gets at, in fact, I didn't really answer your previous question, <laugh>, this is the answer to that, is that, so, so I decided that if you, so to have music accompany a meal, I wanted to sort of respect the, tradition of communal dining, that, that you're there often with other people and you're having conversations while you're eating the meal. So I didn't want it to be something really austere where, you know, you can't talk, you have to just shut up and eat. Sure. And, and so I thought, that the best way to achieve that would be to, to borrow elements of sound installation and to put a speaker at each seat and play the sound through a speaker. So it's all charismatic sound. Oh. So there's no, there's no, there are no live performers. And I, and that's sort of based on my own experiences. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>You know, when I hear live performers in a restaurant, I think of, you know, very common examples would be like in a Mexican restaurant, there's a mariachi band that comes around. Right. And, and I, I love to hear that music, but I also feel like when they come to my table, I feel like I need to kind of put down my knife and fork and, you know, afford them the respect that a living performer deserves. And, and that those things I feel sort of interfere with each other. Or either that, or there's a stage on the other side of the restaurant somebody's performing. And, and that can be nice. But at the same time, it's, it's very, it's, it's, it's a different source of information than what's on your plate. And so I thought by putting a speaker as sort of the centerpiece of the table, like instead of evasive flowers, you have a little speaker right there, and that, that brings the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>It, it places it as close as possible to the dish so that the focus is on the, on the, the plate. That there's not a stage going on somewhere else with some, something else you should pay attention to. But all of the focus is on the table, and the plate really becomes the stage for the, for the performance. And so that's why the sound is all delivered through these speakers. And, and then the, the hard part is making sure that since everybody's listening to these speakers out loud, that it somehow, blends together in a, in a controlled way, that it's not, just CCOs and every, everybody's listening to different things. So there's a system in place that's coordinating this is why it has to be a real time thing. Another reason it has to be a real time thing is that all of the harmony and the rhythm of all of these different speakers is being coordinated so that everybody's in the same Sure. Every has the same beat referential. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's really interesting. And I especially imagine the situation with the stage can be weird because not only does it, I mean, it draws everything away from what you think of as an intimate and wonderful meal. You know, whether you're sharing it with someone else, or in this case, sharing a performance with other people, drawing your attention to <span style="color:red" data-ts="880.965" data-end_ts="881.045" title="880.965" id=c_"880.965">__a__</span> stage is like the opposite of what you'd <span style="color:red" data-ts="882.965" data-end_ts="883.125" title="882.965" id=c_"882.965">__wanna__</span> accomplish. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. I saw, actually a, a textbook example of what I want to avoid last summer. So I, I, so I've been teaching at Berkeley, this is my fifth year at Berkeley. The first two years I was teaching at our, at our campus here, I was teaching the film scoring department. Actually, we have a video game scoring minor that I was brought in to help out with. Okay. And then the subsequent two years I was teaching at our brand new campus in Valencia, Spain. And so I just got back from Spain last fall. Now I'm back and I'm teaching in our electronic production design, electronic production and design department here with, same department as Matthew, as you mentioned. Right. And, so for those two years in Spain, so living in Valencia last summer, I got over to Ibiza for, we actually went just for a weekend for my wife's birthday. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And there's a new restaurant there, which is a collaboration between Albert Riaa, who's the brother of Ferran riaa, who's one of the big famous celebrity chefs bui. And, known for just a lot of, pioneering innovation in the world of gastronomy. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, and his brother is also a very active entrepreneur and restaurateur. And I think, I think his background is maybe pastry chef. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="961.405" data-end_ts="961.485" title="961.405" id=c_"961.405">__should__</span>, I'm not sure about that actually. But they have a, launched a collaboration with Cirque <span style="color:red" data-ts="966.365" data-end_ts="966.445" title="966.365" id=c_"966.365">__de__</span> Soleil in Ibiza called Heart or Heart Ibiza, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="970.085" data-end_ts="970.125" title="970.085" id=c_"970.085">__know__</span>, I'm sure if you're supposed to call it heart or Heart Ibiza. But we went there last summer and, because it's a collaboration with Cirque <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.165" data-end_ts="976.205" title="976.165" id=c_"976.165">__de__</span> Soleil, there are a lot of theatrical elements and Yeah, you can, you can, I can 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See where this is going. <laugh> Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And, and it's, it's really, it was, so the food was great. It was really great, but the environment <span style="color:red" data-ts="989.655" data-end_ts="990.005" title="989.655" id=c_"989.655">__where__</span> it was two totally different things mashed together. Right. There were performances going on on the other side of the room. And what they would even do sometimes is they would dimm the lights totally asynchronous with what I'm eating. 'cause everybody's eating, you know, asynchronously <span style="color:red" data-ts="1004.325" data-end_ts="1004.485" title="1004.325" id=c_"1004.325">__is__</span> right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1004.745" data-end_ts="1004.965" title="1004.745" id=c_"1004.745">__is__</span> typically is the case in a restaurant. So, you know, I'd be enjoying a dish, and then the lights would dimm, it'd be this sort of lurid blue light on my, on whatever I was eating. And then there would be a performance, you know, dancers would come through the aisles and do a little performance, and then the lights would come back up and my food would be, you know, that much colder. Right. And just totally at odds with, with, with the meal, like totally outta sync. So sort of in a lot of ways the opposite of what, what I'm trying to accomplish, like trying to use technology to enhance and focus and, and follow the rhythms of the meal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So how much of a foodie are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I'm a I'm a foodie. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> sounds like it. I mean, you're very thoughtful about, about it, and I'm just, I was just curious how you, how much you would consider yourself, that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>It's, it's a huge world, you know, and it's, it's, I do my best to pay attention and do research, but there's more stuff coming out all the time. And so I, it, it's, you know, I try to stay on top of things, but there are so many developments. It's gotten to be such a, every month you see a variation on this headline that, you know, that chefs are the new rock stars. Right. So it's, there's just a ton of interest in this world. And I, I just, love to follow it and love to just see what's, what's coming up. But increasingly you see people doing, other people doing things with music and food or, you know, these, this, like the cir cir <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.395" data-end_ts="1101.685" title="1101.395" id=c_"1101.395">__sole__</span> thing. Probably one of the most, well-known examples of, music and food pairing is Hesston Blumenthal at his restaurant, the Fat Duck in Bray, England, about an hour, I think, outside of London. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And they, I've been out there, but they, the restaurant was actually closed for renovations, and he sort of decamped to Australia for most of the last year. So I actually gave a presentation to the research and development staff there, about my work last April. So they were working on researching and, and planning the grand reopening of the Fat Duck, which has now been open for a couple of months, I think. Okay. But there's a famous dish there called the Sound of the Sea, which I think was developed in 2007. So this goes a ways back, and it's a variation. It's basically, it's a seafood dish that is sort of rendered to look like a slice of beach. It looks like foam on sand, and it's, it's made out of, out of, different kinds of seafood. It's very, complicated dish. I've actually got his cookbook <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And it's served with a conch shell that has an iPod in it and headphones protruding from the conch shell. And so you put on the headphones and you hear the sounds of the ocean and, or the sea seaside. And I've heard a clip of this at a presentation. He worked with this psychologist at Oxford called Charles Spence, who's gotten a ton of press for his work in sort of crossmodal psychology. Yeah, I've heard of him, yes. Yeah, fascinating work. I gave a presentation to that group as well on that same trip, or actually subsequent trip, no previous trip anyway, last, last spring, about a year ago. And just really fascinating to see all the work that they're doing. He's got a book out too, which is just a wonderful compendium. A lot of, a lot of this research. But, that's something that I thought about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>You know, people often ask, well, why don't you use headphones for your project? And headphones can be something that are very, it, it's a way to really put you in a world. You're really enveloped in a, in a world of taste and sound. And that can be a really powerful, poignant, nostalgic experience. But I feel it doesn't really scale to a whole evening length experience. It cuts you off from the rest of the dining room and from the people that you probably came to the restaurant with. Right. And let alone just sort of be uncomfortable if you, you know, the, the food opera events that we did here were like two hour, maybe more experiences. And, I just don't think I would want to be listening to headphones in a restaurant for two hours. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And actually a variation on that. So I haven't experienced the sound of the Sea, but I have experienced, another dish that involved headphones, which was a crazy collaboration between the performance artist Marina Abramovich and a pastry chef named Kevin Lasko, I believe, at a restaurant called Park Avenue Winter in New York. I think, I think it was 2011 or so when that, when that came out. And it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1284.925" data-end_ts="1285.045" title="1284.925" id=c_"1284.925">__a__</span>, a similar type of thing. There was a nice little box with an iPod in it, and you put on the headphones and it was Marina Ramich describing the dish as you, as you consumed it. And, so she was, I'm not gonna do my Marina Abramovich accent <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1298.965" data-end_ts="1299.045" title="1298.965" id=c_"1298.965">__but__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1300.025" data-end_ts="1300.245" title="1300.025" id=c_"1300.025">__cr__</span> it's, you know, crunchy, cold, burnt, all of these ideas that would sort of draw your attention to different aspects of what you were tasting. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's interesting. Yeah. So I'm kind of curious, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is exploring people's backgrounds. And I'm a little curious about what kind of background you, you have. What was your journey to become the artist that you are, especially since it's clear that, you know, you're doing video game audio, you're doing composition for this very specific kind of thing, but also clearly well versed in generalized, music production and music development. Berkeley's not gonna take you as, as a food audio expert, right? You have to have, you have to have a really broad set of skills in order to pull that off. How did you get where you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I think it's maybe not ridiculous to start, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1363.465" data-end_ts="1363.685" title="1363.465" id=c_"1363.465">__and__</span> to trace it back to my upbringing, I had a very international upbringing. And I think that introduced me just to the idea that there are different ways of looking at things Very early on. I lived in, so my folks are missionaries, so I lived, well, I was born in Nebraska, and then, a little bit of Milwaukee, and then a little bit of Ohio, and then moved to Southern California. And that's when I started kindergarten. So, moving around quite a bit. And then for six years while I was growing up, we lived in Liberia, west Africa. Okay. And I went to boarding school in Ivory Coast and got a little bit of also sort of, learning. Liberia has never been a colony, but has close ties with the us. But Ivory Coast was a French colony, so another culture there as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Not only different African cultures, but also different colonial cultures. I think that that experience of just moving around and living in different countries growing up just kind of opened up my, my mind to the idea of keeping an eye out for different ways of, of looking at a problem. So I, I grew up listening to, didn't really have a strong sort of classical background, although I studied classical piano for a bit while I was growing up. But started fiddling with keyboards and synthesizers in sort of junior high, high school, and writing little pop songs. Also singing in church choirs because of that. So it was Lutheran church. So, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1451.725" data-end_ts="1451.925" title="1451.725" id=c_"1451.725">__lay__</span> claim to Bach in that tradition. So, growing up around a lot of that great stuff. And, and so then I went to St. Ola College and Northfield, Minnesota, studied classical music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And of course there's a strong, choral music tradition there. And actually, I still write a lot of choral music, but that's also where I started doing computer music for the first time, using some, doing some C sound and just using a computer to do sequencing or digital audio editing. And, and then, so after graduating from St. Olaf, got a job at Sierra, the pioneering video game company. So I was there for seven years. It was right after they had moved their headquarters from California to the Seattle area. And so I lived in Seattle for eight years. That's the longest I've lived in any city <laugh>. And then the second longest I've lived in any city is Shanghai, actually. So I moved from there to, to China in 2004, and while I was there, so took the job with Ubisoft, was also active in the art scene while I was there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Very interesting sound art scene. A lot of people doing noise music and things like that. So I played on a lot of the shows. And, probably around that time that I started doing more, like when I was living in Seattle, I had some friends that I would work with and we'd put on shows and some, it was a composer's collective, but we did sort of, some of the stuff was more kind of maybe performance art oriented. And then when I got to China, I was separated from those collaborators. So I started doing more with, sort of laptop performances. And I'd been using Mac for maybe two years before that, but that's when I really got into using Mac for a lot of, like live realtime, stuff. And so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1553.125" data-end_ts="1553.245" title="1553.125" id=c_"1553.125">__I__</span> started doing more, for a long time. I had thought of my work in video games as a kind of virtual sound installation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And so I started, getting involved in actually taking these video game organizational concepts and applying them to physical spaces, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1566.965" data-end_ts="1567.205" title="1566.965" id=c_"1566.965">__thing__</span> audio behaviors that could continue indefinitely that had some type of generative or responsive, aspect to them. And then ended up in the, in the Boston area, about five years ago, actually following, following my wife who's going to grad school, and then, ended up teaching at Berkeley for, well, coming up on five years ago. And that, that's another interesting story of how I got that gig, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1590.425" data-end_ts="1590.645" title="1590.425" id=c_"1590.425">__May__</span>, maybe illuminating, although maybe a little bit of a tangent <span style="color:red" data-ts="1594.005" data-end_ts="1594.125" title="1594.005" id=c_"1594.005">__I__</span> can share the story. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1594.685" data-end_ts="1594.885" title="1594.685" id=c_"1594.685">__No__</span>, let's, let's dive in. <laugh>. So I was, so the time that I, most of the time that I was living in China, my parents were living in Kenya. As I mentioned, there were, missionaries with the Lutheran church. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And I went to visit them with my, my girlfriend at the time, and my wife. And while we were visiting for a few weeks, we decided to pop down to Tanzania. Neither of us had ever been to Tanzania. And turned out there was a big music festival going on, on the island of Zanzibar. So we went to Zanzibar for this, it was called <span style="color:red" data-ts="1629.975" data-end_ts="1630.325" title="1629.975" id=c_"1629.975">__Tiara__</span>, which is I think Voices of Wisdom in Swahili. And it was mostly East African music. And there was a great band from Ethiopia that played one day. And at the end of the day, I was at a, one of the local bars, and I saw the band from Ethiopia. And I just went up and started talking to them and saying, Hey, really, Doug, you're set. And it turned out that the trombone player was a guy named David Harris who teaches at Berkeley. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And that was right when we found out that we were gonna be heading to the Boston area. And I said, well, if you're gonna be in Boston, you know, he, we, I'm just telling him a little bit about, you know, my background in video games. He said, there are people who might wanna know about that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> at Berkeley, since they've just started this video game scoring minor. So when I got to town, I gave a presentation at, there's this, monthly video game meetup where people just present on, on their work. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1679.585" data-end_ts="1679.805" title="1679.585" id=c_"1679.585">__So__</span> different person presents every month. So I shared a little bit about my work on, on N <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.605" data-end_ts="1683.805" title="1683.605" id=c_"1683.605">__Word__</span>, Ubisoft, and I invited, the guys that he put me in touch with to, to come along. And one of them, my, my colleague Michael Sweet showed up and, I guess he liked my talk. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>He invited me to come talk to his class. So I gave a presentation to his class, and then over the summer, they said, Hey, you wanna teach at Berkeley? And I said, okay. So I, I love telling that story to my students because it's, it's, I didn't, I didn't start talking to these guys in the bar because I wanted a job at Berkeley. Right, right. It was because I was really into their music. Yeah. And I think that that's what I try to tell people is just to, you know, put yourself in the situations where you're gonna meet the kind of people that you wanna be around. And, you know, by showing a genuine enthusiasm and curiosity. I think that just, that leads to stuff 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's a great story and, and some great advice because I think a lot of times, I think a lot of times people think that these kinds of career decisions or these kind of career arcs come from very, very calculated movement through a, a career trajectory. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1753.595" data-end_ts="1753.885" title="1753.595" id=c_"1753.595">__they__</span> don't realize that most often it's because you happen to become friends or friendly with somebody, and on a fluke that turns into a career path. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. I think that's so true. And, you know, a lot of, there's people often say, well, you know, it's, it's who you know. But it comes down to the fact that you can get to know people, right. It's not like you're, you're born with a set of connections or something, but just, you know, getting out there and for people, and a lot of my students wanna get into video games and increasingly just all over there are, there are, you know, communities of people who are just interested in that kind of stuff. There'll be local game industry meetups, like this Boston Postmortem that I mentioned, or, or composer groups or things like that. And just, you know, going to these things just kind of showing up and getting to know people and work on the, you know, the connections and making friends and show a genuine interest in it rather than, just trying to look for the job. And then a lot of times those opportunities will just naturally emerge. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, one of the things I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1818.525" data-end_ts="1818.645" title="1818.525" id=c_"1818.525">__to__</span> kind of dive into just a little bit, because I'm curious about it, as you've talked about the different paths you've taken, one of the things that you've talked about is having the opportunity to speak to a pretty crazy variety of folks. You know, so, you're, you go to this famous restaurant, you talk to their r and d staff, or you go to, you go to a place and you, you speak to, you know, whomever, scientists or, or artists or whatever. You seem to find yourself in a position to have like these talks to people. How do you generate that? How do you make it so that first of all, you find the opportunity to talk to people, but secondly, so that you get an interesting group of people willing to listen to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Hmm. Well, I think it, I think it's good to just not be inhibited about talking to people, the, the Oxford Connection and also through that, the Fat Duck connection came through a friend of mine, Janice Wong, who did her master's here at, at MIT, at the Media Lab. And she also helped out on the food opera events that we did here. So now she's doing her PhD with Charles Spence at Oxford. And so while I was living in Spain, she said, why don't you come up and give a talk? And while I was in town, we did a, a wine music pairing at a local, wine bar. And then as I was leaving, I was speaking with Charles Spence and he said, you know, since you're in Spain, you should swing by this conference. It's happening next month. It's called Dialogo Stina, which was happening in San Sebastian. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>So I was over in Valencia on the Mediterranean coast. San Sebastian is sort of north, Atlantic Coast, Basque country. And I'd never been there, been dying <span style="color:red" data-ts="1928.345" data-end_ts="1928.565" title="1928.345" id=c_"1928.345">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1928.565" data-end_ts="1928.725" title="1928.565" id=c_"1928.565">__go__</span>. And this was a perfect excuse. And it worked out with my schedule. So I flew out and it was like a two day conference. And the theme for this, so, so San Sebastian, that's the city with the highest number of Michelin stars per capita in the world. It's a real epicenter for gastronomy. You've got, I mean, you also have sort of the, over on the other side, sort of north of Valencia up in Barcelona and, and Catalonia, that's also, that's where Bui was. And, a lot of great chefs there as well. But those are sort of the two hubs in, in Spain. So the, this conference was called <span style="color:red" data-ts="1965.525" data-end_ts="1965.765" title="1965.525" id=c_"1965.525">__Dial__</span> Athena, like, I guess dialogues of the kitchen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And it was co sort of, it was hosted by this, new institution. It's been around about as long as Berkeley's campus in Valencia called the Bos Culinary Center. And a lot of the leading chefs of that region are on the, the board of this Bos culinary center. So there was a lot of, a lot of those chefs were also involved as sort of hosts of this event. And one of them is a guy named <span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.615" data-end_ts="1993.965" title="1993.615" id=c_"1993.615">__Anoni__</span> Luis <span style="color:red" data-ts="1994.485" data-end_ts="1994.605" title="1994.485" id=c_"1994.485">__a__</span>, who's the chef at Mugaritz, which is currently for the last two years, has been ranked the number six best restaurant in the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2004.665" data-end_ts="2004.885" title="2004.665" id=c_"2004.665">__he__</span>, he was one of the most sort of visible faces throughout the conference, just sort of on, on panels and welcoming people. And, and, and the theme of this conference, it was a culinary conference. It was called, the theme of it was Lavan Guardia, so like the avant-garde. And, and there were talks on what is next for technology in restaurants, what is the history of the avant-garde and the arts, and what can, how does this connect to the history of gastronomy? So it was a very forward thinking, conference. And as an aside, every, you know, most of the conferences that I go to are like, you know, I go to the web audio conference, or I go to the Game Developers Conference. Those are two that I was at just earlier this semester. You know, tech conferences or game developer conferences where you get, you know, maybe stale coffee at the coffee breaks, or, you know, pastries out of a box or something. And, at this, every coffee break was just like, sample this artisanal ham from our local provider, and Right. How would you like a glass of this fine rioja? And it was amazing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2064.185" data-end_ts="2064.405" title="2064.185" id=c_"2064.185">__And__</span> I just thought, yeah, I thought, never wanna go to a technology conference again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>But the, throughout everybody that I spoke to, you know, the coffee breaks or whatever, everybody said, oh, you need to talk to Anoni. He's really into, you know, when I would talk about the work that I'm doing, they're like, oh, he'd be really into this. And there was really no way for me to, nobody wanted to introduce me to him, or he, nobody knew him well enough. So at the end of the second day, I just kind of walked up to him and my Spanish is not so great. It got better while I was there, but not, not super fluent <laugh>. And so I just kinda walked up to him, and in my best Spanish, I was like, Hey, I have this project maybe is interesting to you. And, so he, he was curious and I, I just sort of showed him a little, little bit of a, I think a video of what I had done, showed him some of the software, and he was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2109.885" data-end_ts="2110.045" title="2109.885" id=c_"2109.885">__re__</span> why didn't you tell me sooner? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And, he invited me to come back and give a presentation to his r and d staff last summer. And, and then I also had a chance to meet up with him and some of his other chefs that he works with when he was one of the invited lecturers at Harvard Science and Cooking lecture series last fall. So I gave him, after he had given his presentation there, I invited them to Berkeley and I gave them a tour of our new, we just built some new studios and, showed 'em some of our facilities. And, and, and that was something where it was just, I mean, so partly just deciding to go to this conference where, you know, initially it might've not seemed like the obvious place for me to be. But then also just being, you know, I think just not having any inhibitions because you realize that people, people, you know, are curious, people are, you know, they like, they like to learn new things. They like to talk to people. And I think, I think just having that realization has allowed me to be willing to, to chat with people and, you know, not be shy about, about meeting folks 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, one, this is really interesting you say it that way, because one of the things that a lot of musicians talk about is the seeming disinterest in the general public about music and musicians, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and I would tend to agree, there's every, every performing venue is chockfull of people performing music. And as a result, it can seem like me, whatever, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I think that you, you've cracked something there, and it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2207.265" data-end_ts="2207.485" title="2207.265" id=c_"2207.265">__and__</span> it reminds me, or it makes me think of an experience I've been having. My experience is that I started doing visual art for dance for a dance company, right? And, you know, the, the idea of interacting musically with, with dance is obvious, but doing video art in conjunction with, with the answers has been really amazing. But all of a sudden it's like, people are really interested and these people want to talk and they wanna talk endlessly. And then they're like, oh, and you do sound too, and does the sound work in a way similar, you know? And it's like, because it's this very focused interest area that's not musical, the idea of bringing music or, and it's not visual arts. And so bringing visual artwork into play all of a sudden becomes very, very interesting and very exciting for these people in a way that if I'm just like saying, Hey, you know, I'm gonna play, you know, ambient music in a bookstore, everybody's like, yawn, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><laugh>. Exactly. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so there's something about finding these very specific and kind of peculiar context that seems to really open the door for, for music to be appreciated and maybe appreciated in a completely new way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. I think you're, you're absolutely right about that. I think, you know, I can, there's certainly many sides to this question and I can totally identify, and I've been to a lot of concerts that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2304.005" data-end_ts="2304.125" title="2304.005" id=c_"2304.005">__are__</span>, I think the music's absolutely fantastic. And why isn't anybody else here, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, and there's definitely, I see this also from, even from people, you know, you see the visual arts world has, has increasingly embraced, sound and, and sound art as sort of a part of that practice. But even a lot of people working in that area seem to like the idea of sound more than they actually like the sound <laugh>. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2328.765" data-end_ts="2328.965" title="2328.765" id=c_"2328.765">__dunno__</span>, I, I don't dunno if you've observed that too, but Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>So, so I, I totally see that. And, and it is, you know, there's also, you know, the observation that that, you know, contemporary art is hot and sells for zillions of dollars, and contemporary music is like, I don't know, maybe there's something on TV tonight. You know? Right. So, so I definitely, you know, that, that that's a complicated problem, and I, I definitely see that side of it, but I think that what you're suggesting is, is, is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2358.845" data-end_ts="2359.045" title="2358.845" id=c_"2358.845">__as__</span> absolutely right on that. There are ways to tie that to other experiences. I think that one, one way outta that impasse, if it is an impasse, is to look at how sound can be linked to other media. So whether it's dance or, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2374.135" data-end_ts="2374.355" title="2374.135" id=c_"2374.135">__and__</span> for me linking it to food has been a great way to do that. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I would say certainly though too, you know, during the timeframes that you were, you were working on video games, that was a real transition time where, game audio was becoming much, much more sophisticated as well. So even in that context, you were bringing sound, art, and musical arts, and, and kind of like pushing the envelope in that world as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>That, that's really true. I really see, like a lot of the early first couple of years that I was working in the game industry, I mean, this was like, you know, I started in the industry probably a few days shy of, maybe a month shy of 20 years ago was when I started the industry. And it's been a very interesting time. 'cause when I started in the industry, it was right around the time when computers were fast enough to play back relatively high quality digital audio, multiple streams of it, you know, mix it in real time. Right. And that started to open up a whole new sort of category of things you could do with sound in a, in a computer game. And Sierra was primarily focused on computer games more than console games <span style="color:red" data-ts="2441.035" data-end_ts="2441.235" title="2441.035" id=c_"2441.035">__or__</span> Right. You know, and so for a lot of the early, the first couple of years in the game industry, I was really like, it didn't take me long before I realized, oh, hey, this John Cage guy that I studied in school, <laugh> actually has a lot to do with the way that we author sound in this inherently indeterminate medium. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>You know, if you're, if you, you, you can't make a video game without incorporating indeterminacy. And rather than just sort of just trying to think about, well, what do we do with indeterminacy? You can actually look and see that there's a quite a history of approaches and solutions that people have found to these problems. How do you structure something in an environment where you don't know how long that it's gonna last or you don't know what's gonna happen next? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So a lot of the early days of my, my work in the game industry, were trying to look to, you know, John Cage or to, you know, Stockhausen's Klaviyo <span style="color:red" data-ts="2492.575" data-end_ts="2492.795" title="2492.575" id=c_"2492.575">__El__</span>, which is the, the one that has the form that's basically kind of a webpage that you just go from one cell to the other arbitrarily, and see how we can incorporate some of those models into a video game music context. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And then more recently, my work has been about how to get ideas from the world of video games and take them out into a broader cultural arena. And so I think with sound, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="2516.705" data-end_ts="2516.925" title="2516.705" id=c_"2516.705">__you__</span>, you can, you can think of sound as, having become very devalued, as partly as the way that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2525.485" data-end_ts="2525.605" title="2525.485" id=c_"2525.485">__the__</span>, the media, the media that we use to, to disseminate and consume sound has changed. So if you think of going from sort of LPs to CDs to an iPod and, you know, to, to the point that, you know, a, a track would be reduced to just a line on a screen. And then I thought, I thought that was sort of the, the needier. And then I realized that, that now we don't even have that people are listening to anonymously curated playlists and people don't even know who they're listening to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Right. So it's even less than a little line on an iPod. Yeah. And so I feel like part of the reason that, that it's interesting to connect music to other art forms is because it gives it that sense of immediacy gives it, something that you, you need to really be there to, to experience in a kind of authentic way. If it's not too cheesy to say, you know, authenticity, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2576.665" data-end_ts="2576.885" title="2576.665" id=c_"2576.665">__it__</span>, it's something that, you know, you, you can, it's routine. You can have either, you know, through a streaming service access to 30 million songs, or you could have a huge hard drive of all of your favorite MP threes or whatever, but you can't download a meal for later, right? Right. You need to be there. And so that's a way to reintroduce that sense of immediacy and that sense of urgency and that importance to really be there in the moment, to experience it when it happens into the music. So whether that's through collaborating with dancers, as you mentioned earlier, or whether it's through, collaborating with chefs and having, having that sort of something that hits you from a couple of different senses, that gives you really a reason to be there.

<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2618.025" data-end_ts="2618.245" title="2618.025" id=c_"2618.025">__Ben__</span>, I could talk to you for hours. There's a lot more that I would like to dig into, but we've kind of hit, hit our time. Aot man on this. I appreciate you taking the time to talk with me. I wanna make sure that we're you and I get a chance to catch up in the future because I think we have a lot more to discuss. Absolutely. But before we let you go, why don't you just let people know where they can go to find out more about your work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Oh, sure. So I have a webpage@www.benhogue.com, that's B-E-N-H-O-U-G e.com. And, that's, that'll pretty much point you in the right direction for other stuff. The, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2659.325" data-end_ts="2659.365" title="2659.325" id=c_"2659.325">__in__</span> the process of putting together a, another website that's more about this, this food opera project, but that's not live yet on the zeitgeist website. They've got information about the upcoming St. Paul Food Opera, and that'll be part of it in May, another part of it in October. And hopefully soon we'll be announcing another one in the Boston area as well. But, there's stuff up on SoundCloud, there's this stuff sort of scattered around, so, probably my webpage is the best bet.

<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. Sounds great. Well, thanks again for your time, and for your work. It sounds fascinating and it's really exciting to think about, you know, again, opening people's minds and opening other artists' minds to the idea of interacting outside of the typical context. I think it's way too easy to say, well, I'm a musician, so I gotta go play in a club. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, or I'm an artist and I gotta go hang stuff in a gallery. Yeah. I think it's really fantastic to think about, the variety of places where these, where this artwork can exist and kind of coexist with other fabulous arts. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah, I think that's so important. I actually, I, last summer I taught a class at Berkeley's Valencia campus that was all about the technology behind the Food opera project. And it was, the students were in our music technology program, so they were, they were learning Max programming, and I was showing them some of the techniques that I used to, to generate music or to respond to, to these events. And I, the point of that class was not so much that I thought they were all gonna go out and write more food operas, <laugh>, but it was, it was just to get them thinking about, well, what else could I attach my music to? You know, what other the possibilities are out there. So, so, yeah, I think that's a, that's a, a wonderful thing to encourage people to do. 
</p>

<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thanks so much, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2768.425" data-end_ts="2768.645" title="2768.425" id=c_"2768.425">__Ben__</span>, and we'll talk again soon. Yeah. 
</p>

Many thanks to Ben for hanging out and talking about, the intricacies of doing audio and doing composition for foodies. It seems like a really exciting way to go. Thank you so much for listening. Thank you for keeping on tuning in and tuning other peop, turning other people <span style="color:red" data-ts="2800.565" data-end_ts="2800.845" title="2800.565" id=c_"2800.565">__onto__</span> the podcast.
