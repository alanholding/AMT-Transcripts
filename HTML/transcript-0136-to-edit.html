<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great pleasure of getting a chance to talk to somebody that I've known, actually, kind of known for a long time. We were co occupants of the city of Milwaukee for a while. Back then we kind of occupied different versions of, that area's music scene, but we've also got a lot of friends in common. We've had the opportunity to perform together a little bit. He's one of the people that musically I respect incredibly in this world, and, and also whose, breadth of work is pretty impressive. His name's Paul <span style="color:red" data-ts="48.395" data-end_ts="48.685" title="48.395" id=c_"48.395">__Vook__</span>, and, he is a great musician and a great recordist, and a great writer. And with that, I'm gonna shut up and let him talk about himself. Hey, Paul, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul Vnuk: </b>I'm good. Darwin how you, doing, man? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm, I'm fine. <span style="color:red" data-ts="62.555" data-end_ts="62.845" title="62.555" id=c_"62.555">__Well__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Welcome back to the Midwest. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, thanks. It feels great, actually. It's, it's been hot <span style="color:red" data-ts="67.645" data-end_ts="67.805" title="67.645" id=c_"67.645">__as__</span> sin this week, but I don't know, somehow it feels like coming home to me, so there you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So, talk about myself. Wow, that sounds so, you're always taught to never talk about yourself, but, where, where should I start? I've been, a musician, <span style="color:red" data-ts="86.065" data-end_ts="86.285" title="86.065" id=c_"86.065">__for__</span>, since I was about 15 years old. Going back, before that I kind of have been a music fan. I was and am, a huge music fan. Started with my, my mom who, was a music fan herself, and I inherited her. I started listening to music when I was five years old, which is, you know, I, I know, kind of weird for some people. And when I say listening to music, I was way into it. I guess back when I was five, we didn't have iPods and iPads and let alone, you know, TVs in every room. But, I would, I inherited my mom's 45 collection. And so, even though this was the mid seventies, I kind of started my journey with music, kind of with the journey of rock. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I started with Everly Brothers and Elvis, and, my grandmother got me into the Beatles. And my mom worked at a radio station and used to bring home records of things that were no longer playable on the air. <span style="color:red" data-ts="142.045" data-end_ts="142.245" title="142.045" id=c_"142.045">__And__</span> a lot of promos. And kind of going from there, I just, I'm a music fan when other kids were building spaceships and castles with their Legos, I was building fake rock stages and recording studios and, putting together my little Lego guys were little, little bands and, and things. So when it got to, and I was always interested in music at an early age from the production standpoint. So I, as much as, you know, the, the Beatles are still my ultimate. And as much as I was into The Beatles, I, I read a lot of books on George Martin and, Jeff Emrich. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And how the Beatles recorded, was just as important to me and magical to me. So, when I was about 15 years old, I started recording some stuff. I had one of those little JC Penney all in one stereos. Do you remember those? You know, you had your cassette deck and your turntable, but it was absolutely, absolutely. Yeah. But it had two cassette decks in it. And if you jammed the buttons in just right, you could actually do a sound on sound feature where you basically, I could play back from one tape to the other tape while over dubbing something on top of it. And I didn't have a drum set. I didn't have any of that. All I had was a, an early Ivanez guitar and a little little amp. And I would stick the, just the microphone that came with the stereo <span style="color:red" data-ts="218.865" data-end_ts="219.085" title="218.865" id=c_"218.865">__in__</span>, in front of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And I would make, I, I would, I would bang on tin cans for the drums, and I would tune the e string down for a bass, and then I would play little punk chords, and I would screech over the top as a punk singer, <laugh>. And, a friend of mine heard that in high school who was forming a band and said, Hey, man, you should be our singer. And I went, okay. Kind of started in punk bands, all through high school. And then as we all got older into college, transitioned more into like, kind of classic rock prog, rock funk, whatever was popular at the time, I started playing keyboards. Not accomplished, but I went and got some keyboards, because typically when a band starts jamming, what does the singer do? They stand there and go, duh. <span style="color:red" data-ts="255.595" data-end_ts="255.885" title="255.595" id=c_"255.595">__Okay__</span>. Or they dance. And I'm not much of a dancer, so I got a keyboard, and I learned that I could not play keys and sing at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So, you know, all of the songs have that moment where I'd be singing. But then we'd do the instrumental break, and I'd go over to the Keys, or I'd play the keys for the intro, but then I'd have to stop as soon as I was singing, you know? So it was a bit weird. But early on, I also became the guy that had the four <span style="color:red" data-ts="276.245" data-end_ts="276.525" title="276.245" id=c_"276.245">__track__</span> cassette Yamaha, MT four X. And I started recording our band. And, you know, right away, I, I didn't really care about the songs as much as I wanted to do things like turn the cassette tapes backwards and record reverse sections and slow things down and keep bouncing 22 tracks down to a mono track and keep layering it. So they were incredibly noisy. That went from there. And at that point, I had met a guitar player, excellent guitar player by the name of Chris Short, by the time I was in college. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And he was doing this kind weird music. And as he likes to tell the story, we were sitting in an English class, and I overheard him talking to somebody, talking about this music that he did, where he would use <span style="color:red" data-ts="315.605" data-end_ts="315.925" title="315.605" id=c_"315.605">__delay__</span> pedals to build up loops and layers, kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="318.785" data-end_ts="319.005" title="318.785" id=c_"318.785">__ala__</span> Brian Eno. Although I had never heard of Brian Eno at the time. And he started saying, you know, it was kind of like that attitude of, yeah, I'm a guitarist. And the young arrogant, he was like, oh, yeah, are you any good? Prove it. And, we got together, started working together, and, formed a couple of prog rock bands over the years as members of the bands would quit and we'd lose a bass player or lose a drummer, we finally went, you know, let's just do this ourselves. And by that time, he had kind of coerced me into ambient electronic Mu at the time, it wasn't ambient music, it was just electronic music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, in 1994, we showed up at a, coffee house. I had a Yamaha SY 77, and, I believe, Roland JV eight 80 or JV 80, the keyboard version. And we showed up and I had a Digitech DSP 1 28 that could do, I think, two seconds of looping. And he had his various digitech looping pedals and things. And we had no idea when we set foot in that coffee house, what we were gonna do. And we started doing bizarre loops and things. We had a drummer that we micd with, one microphone. And then for our second show, we had a percussionist that joined us, and we recorded everything. I rented a, an early dat recorder, the little Sony, TCDD sevens, little, the, the, they called it, it was like the Dat Walkman, right? Recorded our shows, these, these live kind of rough experiments, and got back and we're listening to 'em at my house. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, you know, dat take <span style="color:red" data-ts="407.565" data-end_ts="407.805" title="407.565" id=c_"407.565">__Lewis__</span> away. Digital was like, wow. What we just heard in the, in our headphones is preserved perfectly here. We decided to wade through all of it. We drove to Janesville, Wisconsin, which from Milwaukee is about 45 minutes, maybe an hour away at the time, found an early studio that could actually create CDs, which again, now that's commonplace. In fact, CDs are dead. But back in 1994, if you had a CD man, a CD recorder that was a black art, we took our best songs. They edited them in the computer with no EQing, no compression. And, we put together our first album. And the, the Ambient Duo, world <span style="color:red" data-ts="445.525" data-end_ts="445.805" title="445.525" id=c_"445.525">__Beat__</span> Group, <span style="color:red" data-ts="446.865" data-end_ts="447.085" title="446.865" id=c_"446.865">__mod__</span> was born, which is I think where you kind of first became aware of us. 'cause through through doing that, we did a couple albums and we met some other ambient musicians. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>James Johnson, a guy named <span style="color:red" data-ts="457.825" data-end_ts="458.045" title="457.825" id=c_"457.825">__Uni__</span>, who's, John <span style="color:red" data-ts="459.685" data-end_ts="460.005" title="459.685" id=c_"459.685">__Trotti__</span>, right. Became friends. We kept doing albums together. You know, we did a opening spot for Robert Rich, opening slot for Steve Roach. And Steve liked our music and actually called that, called My House to thank me for opening <span style="color:red" data-ts="473.105" data-end_ts="473.325" title="473.105" id=c_"473.105">__for__</span> him. And then he said, Hey, I liked your stuff. I'd like to hear more. If you're ever interested in me mixing or producing one of your records, let me know. We hung up the phone and it was, you know, in, in the ambient world, you know, the name's Steve Roach is kind of like Frank Sinatra, you know, or The Beatles in the rest of <span style="color:red" data-ts="487.005" data-end_ts="487.085" title="487.005" id=c_"487.005">__it__</span>. So we're all like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="488.035" data-end_ts="488.325" title="488.035" id=c_"488.035">__yeah__</span>, <laugh>. We flew to Tucson and Steve mixed our stuff. We were working with early at the time. We had gone from Dat tape to a DA, and then when we found out we could record and manipulate things in the computer, that was the start of an entire new world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So, I, I always kinda let people know, I'm, I'm really, you know, whereas you talk to a lot of older audio engineers and they're all longing for the days of tape, and they all worked with tape and editing tape. I haven't, I started right on the beginning of digital audio and we, you know, cobbled together a couple PCs. We thought it was amazing. 'cause when we got our first one gig hard drive, we didn't understand what we were gonna do with all that space. Right? We had Sound Forge and cakewalk, and we would record sounds into the computer, manipulate them, slow them down, do all these experiments. We didn't have multi-tracking in a computer at the time that we could save. 'cause there was no storage medium. So we would then bounce that stuff back out <span style="color:red" data-ts="544.165" data-end_ts="544.285" title="544.165" id=c_"544.165">__a__</span> track at a time, or, or try to line it up into, onto the <span style="color:red" data-ts="546.885" data-end_ts="547.005" title="546.885" id=c_"546.885">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="547.005" data-end_ts="547.205" title="547.005" id=c_"547.005">__DA__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And then we took those <span style="color:red" data-ts="548.485" data-end_ts="548.645" title="548.485" id=c_"548.485">__eight__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="548.685" data-end_ts="548.805" title="548.685" id=c_"548.685">__A__</span> tapes to, Steve Roaches studio, and he mixed down our, our second album, which got a lot of traction in airplay. Steve got us on a label outta Canada, and the album got to number two on the NAB charts kind of built up and grew from there. And then parallel to all that, I had met, I had interviewed, for a job at, then it was Sonic Foundry, right? And I, I was working retail at a music store. That was my day job was I was a retail manager for a, for a music chain. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so we were one of the first stores in the country to start carrying the Sonic Foundry products, which was Sound Forge. And then, acid version one. I met a bunch of the people, of course, at Sonic Foundry, and since they were based in Wisconsin as well, they said, well, why don't you come and interview for us? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And I, I did to be their head of their loop development, and I didn't get the job. The job went to a gentleman who, a different gentleman named Mike Scheiber, who then I interviewed with him to be one of his employees. And he said, you know, and, and the strange thing is, is he was familiar with ambient music. He liked Steve Roach and Robert Ridge and Michael Sterns. And so when he heard our stuff, he was like, oh, this is really cool. You guys should be doing some loop libraries. So I interviewed to work with him, and he said, you know, after our interview, based on your personality, I can tell that you are not a guy who's gonna be happy sitting in, a cubicle 40 hours cutting loops. He said, how would, instead, how would you like to just keep your other your day job? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Keep your day day job kid, <laugh>. He then said, would you, you know, but I'll hire you as a freelance, which will actually work out better for you. So I started editing libraries for other people. I, I edited Robert Rich's first library. Robert sent me all his <span style="color:red" data-ts="647.825" data-end_ts="648.045" title="647.825" id=c_"647.825">__DAT__</span> tapes, and we went from there. And then eventually he said, well, hey, now it's time for <span style="color:red" data-ts="651.285" data-end_ts="651.485" title="651.285" id=c_"651.285">__module__</span> to do their own library, which is, I know where you come into the picture. 'cause I remember you coming into music around when I worked there, and actually, actually, I think maybe it was your wife came in and bought you one of my libraries Yep. For Christmas or something. Absolutely. Right. And from there, I remember one time I was reading the, the story kind of keeps going forward. I'm doing ambient music. I'm, I'm doing loop cutting for Sony, which lasted for 15 years, 14 or 12 years about of, of doing loop cutting and product development for their, CNAs <span style="color:red" data-ts="678.885" data-end_ts="679.005" title="678.885" id=c_"678.885">__score__</span> software and things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And parallel to all that, I had lost my job at the music store because the store got sold and the new owner decided that he was gonna manage it himself. And it, it wasn't negative, it wasn't hostile, it was just like, Hey, we're really sorry. And so suddenly I'm unemployed for about a year, and I decided, okay, I'm just gonna hit the ground running. And I paid my own way to NAMM shows and trade shows and <span style="color:red" data-ts="699.785" data-end_ts="700.205" title="699.785" id=c_"699.785">__talked__</span> my stuff and got some future library work with em, audio, and kind of kept my foot in the, in the door. And parallel, parallel to that time I was reading Recording Magazine. And I actually saw your name in the magazine. And I'm like, I know this guy <laugh>. And so I remember, you were hanging out at Nova Music at the time, which was one of the country's largest, synth stores, and one of the first stores to actually do international kind of global synth sales at the time, along with, you know, their, their biggest competitor at the time, I think was a place in California Analog Haven. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I, I was talking to you at Nova and I remember saying, Hey, how'd you get the gig writing for the magazine? And you told me about this guy named Mike Meley. The next time I went to namm, I went and introduced myself to Mike Meley and was talking to him only to find out that Mike Meley was the guy from Team Met, which was an ambient electronic music collaborative. And I'd been emailing him separately and talking about this new different Skies festival that was gonna be happening in Tucson, Arizona, halfway between, Tucson and, and Phoenix at, at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="759.115" data-end_ts="759.725" title="759.115" id=c_"759.115">__Arcosanti__</span> Grounds, which is like this kind of futuristic, caveman city great place, though. It's, and so I was getting involved in doing ambient music or electronic music with this festival that Mike Matley was putting together for that. At the same time, I met him for the magazine. And so they assigned me my first review for the magazine, which I still remember to this day was, 14 years ago, in March. And it was the <span style="color:red" data-ts="783.355" data-end_ts="783.645" title="783.355" id=c_"783.355">__even__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="783.645" data-end_ts="783.885" title="783.645" id=c_"783.645">__Tied__</span> Eclipse, which of course I was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="785.985" data-end_ts="786.205" title="785.985" id=c_"785.985">__wow__</span>, I can't believe I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Reviewing a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>$2,000 processor <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="790.195" data-end_ts="790.485" title="790.195" id=c_"790.195">__unit__</span>. The then editor of the magazine, Lorenz Richner hated my writing style, thought it was terrible, more or less, told Mike Matley that I would never write for the magazine again. And I was dejected and depressed and bummed, but I went out and did the festival. Anyway, met a bunch of great musicians through that. That's where I first met, like, Dave Fulton and, Jim Combs and, and a bunch of guys that I've had long standing working relationships with Joe McMahon. And, anyway, at the time, blue came out with their microphone, the Blue Ball. It wasn't an expensive microphone, but you couldn't get one, and the magazine couldn't get one for review 'cause they were basically shipping them as fast as they could make them. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and Mike that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="831.725" data-end_ts="831.765" title="831.725" id=c_"831.725">__had__</span> bought one. And so he went to Loren and he said, Hey, you know, vin's got one, let's give him another shot. Suddenly I write the Blue Ball Review. And Lorenz kind of, I met with Lorenz in the meantime, in person at the Summer NAMM Show. And, you know, kind of learned his parameters of what he looked for as a, editor <span style="color:red" data-ts="849.505" data-end_ts="849.725" title="849.505" id=c_"849.505">__in__</span> chief at, at first I struggled with it horribly. I'm like, oh, this guy 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Wants me to do all this counterintuitive stuff and it's not creative, and blah, blah, blah. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Over the years, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="858.045" data-end_ts="858.205" title="858.045" id=c_"858.045">__look__</span> back and I'm like, wow. I learned a lot from that guy. I wrote the Blue Ball Review, and suddenly I'm getting more reviews and I'm going from, you know, writing reviews twice a year to three times a year to now being the tech editor of recording magazines. So go figure all the while still doing my elect electronic music. I've done a bunch of solo albums for the Hypnos label. I've done a lot of collaborations with <span style="color:red" data-ts="878.805" data-end_ts="878.925" title="878.805" id=c_"878.805">__a__</span>, a guy who's now sadly passed away. His real name is Gigi, but, he goes by the name ufo. We did a, a series of collaboration albums. One was on a label, out of, the Czech Republic that I also, doesn't exist anymore now 'cause that person passed away. Here's hoping things don't come in threes. You know, I've just, I I continue to play fest electronic music festivals through, throughout the year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I do maybe two or three festivals a year when I have the opportunity to, I will release solo albums. It's been, I think about 12 or 14 years since the last module, <span style="color:red" data-ts="909.125" data-end_ts="909.245" title="909.125" id=c_"909.125">__a__</span> album. And I am just amping the guitars tomorrow for the final track for our new album because, Chris moved from Wisconsin to Johnson City, Tennessee. So now we work long distance. So he'll send me raw dry tracks and I'll reamp them at my studio, which I also have a, a full op operating recording studio as my current status. That was my history. My current status is I, I more or less have three jobs, which is, I am the tech director, full-time tech director of a, mid-sized church in Racine, Wisconsin. I also am the technical editor of recording. And then I have my own recording studio where I will record clients and bands and do some sound design still from time to time when I can. That's where I'm at 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That's, quite a, a trail that you've walked now that gives me about 50 questions, of course, <laugh>. And I'm really curious because a lot of, a lot of this is, it sounds familiar because I think that there's something about growing up in the Midwest and Midwest of the United States and growing up with a fascination with sound that almost that, and growing up at a time when all of a sudden things like a, the four track cassette comes along, right? Or the dat machine comes along, or the A dat comes along, or audio capable computers, the way that all of those had such a strong influence, but also sort of a, it, these were the technologies that kind of knit p knit people together into groups. So then all of a sudden, people that could become comfortable with working with a DAT machine would start talking to each other about dat machines and about, and you know, with the nascent, internet coming along, we actually had a way to talk to each other too, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1019.375" data-end_ts="1019.725" title="1019.375" id=c_"1019.375">__right__</span>? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1020.225" data-end_ts="1020.445" title="1020.225" id=c_"1020.225">__Yep__</span>. And so that was, that was kind of a, an interesting, addition to this. So let's, let's kind of talk about a couple of areas though. First of all, I find it really interesting that your mother was worked at a radio station, so you kind of had access to a, a lot of music besides the obvious, you mentioned things like, like The Beatles and some of these things, but what were some of the less obvious things you remember being influential on you at the time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, it's interesting you mentioned that. 'cause my mom actually recently passed away when I was getting things together and ready for her, her memorial service. It, it, it really hit me the impact, you know, you take things for granted in life. And it, it hit me the impact that she had had on, on my being a musician and being supportive of it and bringing home these records and these albums. And, one of the, the funny things I found was I'm like, wow. She was really into music too. And I found that she actually tried to start a Pat Boone fan club when she was a kid and got an actual signed letter from him. And I'm sure nobody out there knows who Pat Boone is anymore, but whatever, you know, the less obvious things. It's weird. 'cause when I, I I, I have an insatiable appetite for music biographies, and I also have an insatiable appetite for, for music, of all kinds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>There's really no musical genre that I don't like. There might be artists I don't like, but I can usually find something redeeming. And part of that comes from, you know, I've worked at three CD stores in my life, and I've worked at a music store. And as a recording engineer, you, you really don't last long in the business. When a client comes in and says, yeah, I, I record Tank Indonesian skiffle house. And you go, oh, I hate that crap. You know, you, you kind of have to learn to like a little bit of everything. I remember growing up thinking that all kids were listening to all this stuff. And I would go to school and my friends would be like, you're a freak. You know? And even now, my wife is one year younger than me and a song will come on the radio or, or whatever, a TV show, and I'll be like, oh, do you remember this song? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And she's like, no, when's it from? And I'm like, 1976. And she's like, I was six years old. I'm like, yeah, I know <laugh>. I remember like from my Mom's 45 collection, I, I love stuff. Like, there's a group, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1146.205" data-end_ts="1146.445" title="1146.205" id=c_"1146.205">__Dell__</span> Vikings, which nobody's ever heard of, but they had a big hit called, cool Shake and Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps. And as I got into, you know, I'll admit this, I guess publicly, but my, my, my two biggest influences in the seventies as a kid growing up were Kiss and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1162.605" data-end_ts="1162.925" title="1162.605" id=c_"1162.605">__REO__</span> Speedwagon. So I guess that must be a Midwest thing. And, you know, for then, of course, as I got older, I, I shunned those bands. No, I don't listen to them anymore. And now as I'm older and I don't care, I go back and I'm like, man, I love early <span style="color:red" data-ts="1175.605" data-end_ts="1175.885" title="1175.605" id=c_"1175.605">__REO__</span> Speedwagon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It was so cool. You know, they, they had a, before their pop period, they had a different singer who had this heavy southern accent named Mike Murphy. And I, I still remember the original version, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1186.705" data-end_ts="1186.925" title="1186.705" id=c_"1186.705">__rod__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1187.065" data-end_ts="1187.285" title="1187.065" id=c_"1187.065">__in__</span> the Storm out, you know, he's got this, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1190.205" data-end_ts="1190.405" title="1190.205" id=c_"1190.205">__like__</span> to kiss for their theatrics. You know, the, the weird thing for me is where I felt a little, when I got to high school, I was a punk guy or a heavy metal guy. So I went through the whole heavy metal period back before it was cool. You know, is it cool now? I don't know. But back then, when I was in high school, most of the guys in my school were, listening to Duran Duran and Pet Shop Boys and Depeche Mode and, and The Smiths and Morrissey. And I hated that stuff at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I was like, oh, that's what the kids I all ought to beat up, listen to. And, and I was into, you know, twisted Sister and Ozzy Osborne and Rat and Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. And, you know, at a time, you know, before it was the hair metal, but it was, you know, kind of an earlier now, now it's more, you know, black Sabbath. I, I would call a lot of that stuff more hard rock than I would <span style="color:red" data-ts="1236.485" data-end_ts="1236.685" title="1236.485" id=c_"1236.485">__metal__</span> compared to what came after, right. And when the hair metal stuff took over, by that time I was into hardcore punk. And, you know, so then I transitioned into, and I still like heavy music. I transitioned into doing ambient music and electronic music, and everybody I meet, I always feel a little weird. 'cause you inevitably you sit down and go, oh, who are your influences? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And these guys are like, oh, I was really big into, Depeche Mode and, and you know, how they used <span style="color:red" data-ts="1260.885" data-end_ts="1261.205" title="1260.885" id=c_"1260.885">__sense__</span> and craft work and Gary Newman. And I'm like, yeah, I never listened to any of that stuff. They're like, what are your influences? I'm like, the Beatles and Zeppelin and, and Hendrix and, and Judas Priest. And that, you know, that that was the stuff I was listening to at the same time. Yet we still come to the same ends with, with music. So I, I dunno if that answered your, your question. I mean, now I, I collect music. So I mean, I, by the time I was in college, I got into jazz and I, I I, I, I started with Fusion and then worked my way back. You know, the first miles Davis I ever heard was Pangea, which is Oh wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And then I worked my way back and I heard kind of blue and it changed my life, even when it comes to ambient music. You know, a lot of people's influences are Eno and, and Tangerine Dream and, and stuff like that. My two first earliest biggest ambient albums that really hit me and stuck with me, and, you know, again, I can thank Chris short for it. 'cause I think he turned me on to both of them were Peter Gabriel's Passion, which is not a, an ambient album, but it was that whole world influence and no lyrics at the time. That was big for me. 'cause I, I, I was a singer and not to have lyrics was like, whoa. And then, an album called Raintree Crow, which was the ex members of Japan, David Sylvia reuniting. And those albums still are probably two of my top albums of my life. And from there I got into Michael Sterns and Robert Rich and Steve Roach and, you know, Tangerine Dream. But, you know, I kind of went through the back door, I guess, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, it's, it's interesting though, because I think that there was something about, you know, the, the late seventies, early eighties, and again, that, that what at the time was called Metal. And I think you properly identified that actually. Now we just would call it like a hard rock, right? But that was actually one of those areas where there was some kind of interesting experimentation going on with recording technique, right? I feel like Depeche Mode and all those things, they were, they were playing with senses and there was sound design of a sort going on, but it was very much an attempt to be clean and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1384.075" data-end_ts="1384.365" title="1384.075" id=c_"1384.075">__very__</span>, you know, the the kind of classic thing of, you know, having the voices be upfront and center and the words are the important thing and all that stuff. I, one of the things maybe that I loved about say, you know, the Kiss's first Live album was that there was, there was this sense by which the bombast was as important as anything they were singing about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And that bombast it was a way to sort of like sonically imply the theater involved in, in their production, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1424.665" data-end_ts="1424.885" title="1424.665" id=c_"1424.665">__Yep__</span>. There was some really interesting recording techniques that were being developed during that time that I think eventually kind of combined kind of meshed with what, what the punk world ended up doing. Because I, I similarly went from kind of really enjoying, the hard rock slash metal stuff to really being enveloped into the punk world, in my case, sort of like the Texas punk world. And, and there was something about the, the sonic precursor of those bands as being really influential on the punk sound, I thought. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I think so. You know, and it's interesting too, is because, again, being an audio engineer, I love the punk bands that sound really recorded Well, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, whereas now there's kind of, we've, we've gotten <span style="color:red" data-ts="1475.965" data-end_ts="1476.125" title="1475.965" id=c_"1475.965">__to__</span> this, you know, okay. So the, you know, the Ramones and the Sex Pistols and, the Clash and things like that. They were punk and they were irreverent and their music was raw, but it was still recorded really well right in, in, in, in top-notch studios at the time. And I, I even started to see the same thing as I started to get into ambient music and synth music, which is what I do appreciate now about Depeche Mode on their first, you know, four, four albums or so, or five albums is, they had no blueprint for that stuff. It was, it was more experimental at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It was even like, you know, at at, at one time people would've considered the humanly experimental. And, and what you saw was is, you know, Eno and Bowie and all these guys, they're in, you know, I'm gonna use the word real studios. They're still going in with their synths and their gear and their analog sequencers and their tape loops and all this. And they're bringing in it and in, and presenting it to actual engineers and producers and saying, this is what we wanna play. You have to figure out how to mic this or how to, you know, get it into the council or how to make this sound good in, in, you know, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1539.205" data-end_ts="1539.405" title="1539.205" id=c_"1539.205">__didn't__</span>, basically, what I'm saying is we didn't have computers, or they didn't have computers back then. They didn't have the ability to kind of hit one button and go, oh, here's my soft synth and, and a couple of loops I bought. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, you know, it, it was, it was kind of trial by fire. And I think the same thing happened with the punk guys. You know, here's this new music. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1557.965" data-end_ts="1558.085" title="1557.965" id=c_"1557.965">__like__</span>, I mean, people don't think about little things, subtle things. Like the first time <span style="color:red" data-ts="1561.085" data-end_ts="1561.405" title="1561.085" id=c_"1561.085">__cream__</span> went to record, it was too loud for the studio they were in, and the engineers are freaking out 'cause they're overdr the console and the mics and the, you know, each little moment like that and the history of recording kind of brought new changes, new techniques, new technologies. The first time they, you know, the Beatles engineers stuck their kick drum mic in the kick drum rather than being, you know, two feet away. You know, all of those things were these little incremental, progressive things that got us to where we are now. And it's almost kind of, you know, soapboxy of me. But it's, you know, now it's kind of getting lost. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It, it sort of is. Well, because there's sort of this, the, you know, a combination of, labels ceasing to have recording budgets. Yep. And, celebration of DIY recording over, you know, say, a professionalism. Now, I, I think DIY is important. I think it's a, it's a critical movement, but I also think that there are, there are places where profe the, the profession of recording is still, still has a level of importance. And now you are a professional recorder. And I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1631.845" data-end_ts="1632.045" title="1631.845" id=c_"1631.845">__it__</span>, to some extent, people would be, are surprised to even hear that there is such a thing as being able to run, commercial recording studio, which is one of the things that you do. What are the kinds of clients that you find coming to a recording studio? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>When I first started, I started in my home and I, I, you know, built everything up one piece at a time. I, I was, again, I, I managed a music store, musical instrument store. So I was able to buy things at dealer cost and, you know, discounts and, and whatnot. And my first, I just kind of put it out there. I went, you know what? I'm gonna take a bedroom in my house and I'm gonna record people. And it's on a, you know, at the time it was a Mackey 16 channel mixer into an a DA. And, I think it was like a cheap Elis reverb and went from there. And my earliest clients were a lot of singer songwriter folk type stuff, you know, people that, it wasn't full bands. It was, you know, two or three people kind of doing a harmony vocal with one acoustic guitar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I, I somehow fell into the Celtic folk scene. And when I say <span style="color:red" data-ts="1690.645" data-end_ts="1690.725" title="1690.645" id=c_"1690.645">__that__</span>, I don't mean like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1691.995" data-end_ts="1692.285" title="1691.995" id=c_"1691.995">__Anya__</span> Celtic, I mean, like, you know, we're gonna storm the castle and take prisoners and chop off some heads, <laugh> Celtic music. You know, that was weird. 'cause that the, the first, one of the first bands I recorded recommended another band. And that band I've now had a nine album run with, and they tour the US and play festivals every year. And I'm the only studio they come back to, which is really an honor. And it's, you know, I've, I've grown at the same time. They've grown on one hand. I do, I fell into the Celtic scene, and at the time I would say I didn't even like Celtic music. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, I can't say it's still the type of thing. I come home and go, I'm gonna put that Celtic music on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I, I don't do that. I enjoy the work I've done with them because they're a great group of people and, and really fun to, to work with. They're called Three Pints Gone. I'll give 'em a little plug over time. I've done a lot of indie rock, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1737.665" data-end_ts="1737.885" title="1737.665" id=c_"1737.665">__but__</span>, and, and that changes all the time. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1739.445" data-end_ts="1739.605" title="1739.445" id=c_"1739.445">__the__</span>, the term almost means nothing. But, you know, basically what's current Rock now, basically people in, in college that are, you know, or post-College that are putting a band together and it's, it's rock. It's, you know, influenced by everything from the Replacements to Radiohead to, you know, whatever's, you know, death Cab for Cutie whatever. And so I'll, I'll record a lot of stuff like that. I've, I did a, I've done a couple Prague albums, Prague Projects, Prague Rock, you know, the more Modern Prague, not so much like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yes. Genesis, but now more like dream theater, tool, that kind of thing. Yeah. But I, I would say, and of course working at a church, I also do a lot of Christian contemporary stuff. So I've, I've fallen into that. I would say if, if, if I had a choice, my favorite thing to record is I still like straight ahead Rock, I guess what you'd kind of say Americana, anything that's kind of the Ryan Adams, not Brian Ryan Adams, Tom Petty. You know, I, I love recording that type of stuff with that, that kind of vibe with the, the mix of acoustic guitars and, you know, vintage, electric guitars through Fender Amps and, you know, Hammond <span style="color:red" data-ts="1804.645" data-end_ts="1804.765" title="1804.645" id=c_"1804.645">__B__</span> three and all that. So I do a lot of that stuff. Strangely, I don't do a lot, you know, I've done a couple jazz albums, you know, actually people setting up and playing live, kind of ECM jazz type stuff, a couple more bebop type sessions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So for me, it, it runs the gamut. I, I would say, you know, I've even done boring things. Like I've had people hire me to do, voice recordings for their telephone system, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Hi. You called the insurance agency. You know, <laugh>, please. I, I, I mean, I'll do anything for, you know, if it, if it pays. I think what sharpened me a lot was the, the work that I did with Sony. Because with Sony I had assigned projects and even budgets to work with where, you know, I, I did a world library for them, and I actually had to set up, send them a proposal, and I had to go find these world musicians. So I had, I had to record African musicians and Arabic musicians and Asian musicians. I, I, you know, I did some like vintage Americano, like a guy came in with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1863.805" data-end_ts="1863.925" title="1863.805" id=c_"1863.805">__a__</span> 18 hundreds, acoustic guitar that was actually repaired in the Civil War, and they used a gun barrel to strengthen the neck, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, and the guitars, intonation was completely wonky, but it had that, that sound of the battlefield in the 18 hundreds. And so doing that, you know, really helped me learn what clean recording was, because when you're doing a sample library or a sound design library for a company, you have to do clean. So I, at the time when I started my studio, I, I geared all of my gear to capturing things cleanly, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> with Millennia Mic preamps, and really clean browner microphones, or, you know, really? And, and I was almost, my friends will tell me I was over the top about it. I mean, even with ambient music, I didn't want one ounce of noise on a recording whatsoever. I would redo things for hours to scrub away the noise. Now I've gone full circle, and I'm a really big fan of the whole Americana thing, and I love the Jack White vibe, and I love, you know, gritty Tube gear, and, you know, I, I love Guitar Amps that buzz and that, that raw <span style="color:red" data-ts="1925.095" data-end_ts="1925.445" title="1925.095" id=c_"1925.095">__sound__</span>, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So to answer your question, I'll, I'll record anything. My clients are all over the board. I do, you know, I, I don't have a, a broad client base. I've got a small client base that keeps returning every other year, you know, so, right. Which, again, that in a way is happier because, I mean, I'm always looking for work, so if anybody wants to record something out there, call me. But, no. What's great about working with Return People is a, I know they're happy and they loved the experience here. They like the sound that I'm able to do or, or to get for them. And, but it's a comfortable working relationship. It's not that initial like getting to know you phase. It's like, they can come in, we can get right to work. They know me, I know them. I actually have some clients that know that I write for a magazine, and I'm always reviewing stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so I'll have people call up and go, Hey, what do you got to review? Because a lot of times I'm reviewing things that are way more expensive than I can afford to own. Right. And I have clients that will come in and take advantage of that. And, you know, why shouldn't they, it it helps me with the review. And, you know, that's one of my things as a reviewer, I, I like to make sure that anything I'm reviewing, I mean, I always insist almost on a, on a two to three month turnaround time, which, you know, some companies are like, whoa, really? And I'm like, yeah, I like to actually put these mics up, use them, record things with them, and, and know how they work in a session, rather than setting them up over the weekend, talking into the mic going, sounds good. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2002.835" data-end_ts="2003.325" title="2002.835" id=c_"2002.835">__Because__</span> I wanted to talk a little bit about your work with Sony. I mean, the, the sample libraries that Sonic Foundry and then Sony were putting out were quite amazing. And I know <span style="color:red" data-ts="2014.885" data-end_ts="2015.085" title="2014.885" id=c_"2014.885">__you__</span>, you had your hand in a lot of 'em, and, you're right. One of, one of the, one of my favorite sample CDs ever was one of the Ola items that, in fact, my wife did buy me for my birthday. But I'm, I was curious a little bit too about some of the decision making, because the way that those, acid loop library things were constructed was unlike a lot of places at the time, they weren't really construction kits. Instead, it was more like, here is an area of sound that we want to explore. We're going to break that down into a couple of vibes and then sort of like, sort of like record some loops in each one of those vibes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I, I found it a really creative way, you know, as a, as an end user, I found it really creative to, to kind of like dive into the sort of organization that existed on those. And I know that I would say probably the majority of sample CDs that I have ever actually used were, those Sony discs. And I think the ones that I actually used were, were probably mostly had gone through your hands. And so there's, there's something about that organization that I found really helpful and useful. How much of that was prescribed for you, and how much of that did you just decide on your own? I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Think it's a little bit of both. I think the, the great thing was, and, and I will credit a lot of this too, the, the guy that I mentioned earlier, Mike Scheiber, who was really developing the, the Sony or Sonic Foundry Loops and then Sony Loops from the beginning pretty much was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2122.385" data-end_ts="2122.605" title="2122.385" id=c_"2122.385">__in__</span>, in the beginning, a lot of the Sony or the Sonic Foundry Loop libraries were, were, were things that were jobbed from other companies. So they would go to Big Fish, they would go to other companies and basically buy the rights to a pre-existing loop library. They would acidize them and release 'em that way. But as they started to develop relationships with, with, with people and, and different loop cutters and sound creators, what I thought was great about the Sony thing and that excited all of us is it was really kind of symbiotic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>We were all learning at the same time. Nobody knew yet what the market was gonna be. Nobody knew what a construction kit was. Often it was, you know, I'm, I'm hiring this artist to do what they do, and then let's cut it into loops. I mean, nobody told Robert Rich to do these kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="2166.005" data-end_ts="2166.085" title="2166.005" id=c_"2166.005">__of__</span> loops or that kind of loops. It was just like, Hey, man, do what you do. You know, who are you? And break it down, you know? So, and, and that's what, you know, like Chris and I did with the, with the, with the module <span style="color:red" data-ts="2175.045" data-end_ts="2175.165" title="2175.045" id=c_"2175.045">__A__</span> libraries was basically we got paid to sit around the studio and experiment. You know? So the things that we would do for ourselves anyway, when it came to albums, basically just taking sound and manipulating it, that's what we would do. We would take raw sounds, whether it was guitar or keyboards, or crunching up leaves in a bowl with rocks and water miking it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>We would take that and run it through, you know, an <span style="color:red" data-ts="2197.125" data-end_ts="2197.565" title="2197.125" id=c_"2197.125">__eventide__</span> processor or a, you know, a TC processor, and then capture that, and then further go into the computer at the time and, you know, stretch things out and slow 'em down and chop them up. And it was a playground, you know, so it was like really sound design with no end concept in sight. It was just whatever came out and happened, happened. And they, you're right. They, they, you know, our stuff anyway, wasn't construction kits at all. It was just, we were having fun and here's some cool loops we did. And the one thing we've never done to this day, which we've joked about it, we've never used our own loops from our libraries and our own music. And we're like, why shouldn't we? It's us, you know? But then as, as Sony went on, as, as we started, when, when it got more corporate, things did get a little more prescribed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I mean, when I got to the point of doing the Continental Drift libraries, which was all the world music that was really, you know, a back and forth. I had meetings with Mike Scheiber at Sony, and we, we talked about, here's what, here's what we want. You know, we want 10, we want 10 songs, we want 10 different parts of the world represented. These have to be, they have to a work together. So you have to be able to take, you know, the, the Japanese Kyoto, actually, it was a Guang. You have to take the, the Guang, and it has to be able to work with the African drumming and has to work with the 18 hundreds Americana guitar. I see. But they also still had to work by themselves as well. So I, I let each of the world people compose their own songs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And then I literally, we tracked as if I was tracking a band and tracking a song, and then I broke each of those songs down into loops. So it was basically a song by song, by song. But then I had to make sure I, you know, I, I basically got everybody to maybe kind of play in the same one or two keys, because as you transpose in Sonic found in acid, you know, the closer the, the original key is to each other, and the closer the tempo is to each other, the easier it is to acidize. So I had to keep all of that in mind as I was creating that project specifically. There were other people there. There's a, like a guy that also worked with Sony for, for years, Jason Donley, who I think you might know, but Jason was one of their top guys for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2317.525" data-end_ts="2317.685" title="2317.525" id=c_"2317.525">__it__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And he's actually gone on to have his own loop company and continues doing that. And Jason, over time got really good at picking genre specific, you know, I'm gonna do an EDM library for Sony, and I'm gonna present it to him and say, do you guys want this? And they would go, yes. Or, you know, but it was still left up a lot to the, the content creators like us. But as it transitioned from Sound Forge, that was kinda the wild frontier as it got into Sony. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2341.685" data-end_ts="2341.805" title="2341.685" id=c_"2341.685">__It__</span> got a little bit more corporate, which I understand. And that became more of like, well, here's what we want. Here's what we think we'll sell. So it was kind of the, you know, the change from the indie label to the major label, if you will. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Do you do much work with sound, sound library creation anymore? 'cause I know, well, Sony in fact, just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2357.685" data-end_ts="2357.965" title="2357.685" id=c_"2357.685">__sell__</span>, sold all their stuff to Magics, I think, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I don't think that they've been putting out loop libraries for quite a while. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>My last library that I did goes back to Mike Scheiber. Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="2368.785" data-end_ts="2369.005" title="2368.785" id=c_"2368.785">__are__</span> finally built his own studio in, in Madison <span style="color:red" data-ts="2371.665" data-end_ts="2371.885" title="2371.665" id=c_"2371.665">__for__</span> two studios. And he is, he did, his first project was finally after all these years of being the guy in charge of the acid loops, he did his own guitar library. He's an amazing guitar player, and has a lot of vintage amps and vintage gear, and Les Pauls and all. And so he did a guitar library, and after he tracked it, he, he basically said, well, you know, I want you to take my raw files now, and I want you to render them through your LA two A and your Chandler TG two. And, you know, he's like, I want you to put the classic recording <span style="color:red" data-ts="2403.245" data-end_ts="2403.565" title="2403.245" id=c_"2403.245">__council__</span> guitar processes right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To touch on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so that was, to this day, the last library that, that I cut, and I think that was probably about four years ago or five years ago, I, for a while, the, the, the work got so fast and furious that I was probably doing 70 to 80 hour weeks going from my day job at the church to writing articles for the magazine and then doing loop libraries where I was literally, there were some projects where there were <span style="color:red" data-ts="2430.845" data-end_ts="2431.045" title="2430.845" id=c_"2430.845">__five__</span>, five of us working on a library and we're emailing and calling each other at four in the morning, you know, trying to, to grapple with things and, and, and directions. And the, the simple answer is, is I don't know if I can do it anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah, I hear that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I think I burnt myself out. I actually, I kind of did my own little, passive aggressive, I moved over to Mac from a PC platform, which is what I, you know, people for years were like, well, you're a recording studio and you use a pc. And it was because of working for, for Sonic Foundry and Sony, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.925" data-end_ts="2463.005" title="2462.925" id=c_"2462.925">__of__</span> course, I had to. So I finally dug my heels in and fell in love with Apogee Converters and went, oh, those are Mac only. Okay, well, I guess I'm going to a, a Mac now. And so essentially, I can't do, I mean, I can cut loops, but I can't acidize them anymore. I, so I will still cut loops if people need them. I will cut loops occasionally. If a client is working on a song and I have an idea, I'll, I'll create a loop rather than using a store-bought one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But I don't really foresee myself maybe ever going back into the, the, the loop cutting. Nor do I do, I know how much of a, a need <span style="color:red" data-ts="2493.645" data-end_ts="2493.805" title="2493.645" id=c_"2493.645">__there__</span> for. I mean, Ableton kind of changed things so drastically where they don't really have to be acidized loops anymore. So I, I could cut a loop that's not acidized and Ableton handles it so well. Right. I, I don't know if I foresee myself going into the library business anymore. 'cause again, I, I don't know what the market's like, you know, it's the type of thing where like music, you put it up and who's to say people are gonna buy it. It's just gonna end up out there and you're doing all this work for free and a little cynical, you know, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it is what it is. I mean, things do change now. Now, one of the things that I think is interesting though, is that you have some, a lot of long form arcs in your career. And one of 'em is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2531.605" data-end_ts="2531.765" title="2531.605" id=c_"2531.605">__you__</span> work with Chris and, this stuff that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2535.585" data-end_ts="2535.805" title="2535.585" id=c_"2535.585">__it__</span>, it's interesting actually to me to hear that you're actually, putting, putting some effort into a new recording there. That's really great. But it also sounds like working with him was the thing that took you from sort of like traditional music form to things that were a little more experimental. Would that be fair? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Absolutely. I, you know, before working with Chris, the weirdest stuff I heard was, you know, the Beatles Revolution number nine, or, you know, the, the, the John Lennon. 'cause I was Beatles, you know, like the John Lennon's two Virgins album, or you know, the, and, and if I, if I said at the time, you know, if my young, young college age self, if I said I was a fan of that, I'd be lying. You know? I'm like, at the time I was like, what is this garbage? You know, why did they do that? And it, it, it, it took a lot of growing and understanding. And in some ways, you know, Chris and I have what I would call a friendly antagonistic relationship. We're like brothers, we love each other, but we know how to, after, you know, 20 years of working together, we know how to push each other's buttons incredibly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And there are still music things we don't agree on at all. You know, I tend to still like music that would operate more in a, in a rock genre or a jazz genre or a pop genre. And Chris, you know, I always joke with him that the weirder it is, the happier he is. You know, he wants things that are, you know, always pushing beyond the boundaries of reality. And, you know, and I think that our meeting in the middle is kind of what makes our music, you know, unique or enjoyable to us. And we also don't let each other get away with second best. So I can tell if, you know, he's not giving his all, he can tell if I'm not giving my all, so we can send each other a track. And it's like, come on, really. You know? And so, and occasionally you get mad 'cause you're like, no, this is, I did this man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, and push each other. And usually in the end when, when we do agree, we're like, yeah, that was it. That was worth pushing for. He, he definitely, I, I would not be doing, I I would not have gotten into ambient music and the sound design aspect of it, probably, if it wasn't for him opening my ears to, again, Steve Roach or Michael Sterns, or Brian Eno, or Kit Watkins, or a lot of that early stuff, and doing the, the sound design things. And at first when I heard 'em, I'm like, ah, I don't know, man. You know. But as I started to do that kind of music, it became really freeing for me, you know? And, and I haven't written a traditional rock or pop song of my own in 25 years 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. The other thing I know about you, certainly whenever we've, worked around each other, you have played the role of a percussionist. Is this something that also came about as part of your work with Chris, or was it something else? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, I, I'm inherently, you know, I'm the person I complain about. I, I'm, when it comes to music and learning musical things, I'm inherently lazy. Meaning I, I owned a guitar, but I didn't wanna learn to take lessons. I took lessons for about six months. It was too painful. I just wanted to play on stage. I didn't wanna do the work. I just wanted to be out there. Then I moved to singing, which was something that I, I, you know, I, I enjoyed doing. And that I took serious enough that when I got to college, I went from being a punk singer to getting conservatory training. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2721.905" data-end_ts="2722.125" title="2721.905" id=c_"2721.905">__So__</span> really, vocal and composition are the only things that I'm quote unquote trained in for music. Like I said, keyboards started as a way for me to do something or appear to be doing something when the band was jamming. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So, but to this day, I tell people I'm not so much of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2736.645" data-end_ts="2736.765" title="2736.645" id=c_"2736.645">__a__</span>, you know, I can't really sit down and play other people's songs. I can, I can kind of fart around, but I, you know, I can wing some Miles Davis stuff or, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2744.165" data-end_ts="2744.285" title="2744.165" id=c_"2744.165">__a__</span>, a couple pop songs that we all know. But I became more of a synthesist, and that's where, you know, Chris really encouraged me to explore that. And so, working with pads and ambience and, and creating sounds in, in, in a keyboard, that really became what I did with Keyboards and still do Now. But percussion, I've always been, you know, I always messed, I, I was always the guy that when the drummer in our bands would, would leave the room, I'd sit down <span style="color:red" data-ts="2765.845" data-end_ts="2766.045" title="2765.845" id=c_"2765.845">__at__</span> his kit and play. When I started getting into jazz, I started really liking jazz drummers, and I started collecting vintage kits. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And then after a while I'm like, well, geez, I've collected a couple of vintage kits. I should learn to play them. They're here. And I started playing the kits When <span style="color:red" data-ts="2780.355" data-end_ts="2780.645" title="2780.355" id=c_"2780.355">__Mole__</span> started, we had a percussionist that, that we would, we would hire. And he was kind of an auxiliary member of the band. Over time, I just, I kind of dug what he was doing, and I dug the drums and I dug the percussion. So I started buying my own and playing more. And that was the first thing that I really felt was me, and that I wanted to learn. So I would, if I, if I could find a guy that could show me some Arabic patterns, I would do it. If I could, you know, watch some videos or, or learn from an African, percussionist playing gbe, I would do it. And, you know, so percussion is the consistent thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And now drums, I've actually, you know, when I, when I started working at a church, I got on their worship team. And so I had to learn to play Christian contemporary music, which at its core is pop music that really kicked my butt. And I, you know, you think pop music is simple but you're playing to a click, you're keeping things really tight and you're, you know, over the last 15 years, drums and percussion have become my first instrument. And keys are something that I only fall back to when I'm doing ambient shows and ambient and gigs. And even that is, it's been a bit of a struggle because the less you do it, the less good you are. And it's only been in about the past year that I've been putting a lot of effort back into my sound design and my synth playing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, I did a festival in Asheville a couple months ago, and I walked away for the first time in years going, wow, this, I, I have to do a solo album now because this is the first time that I feel like I've, I've broken through a barrier, finally again, and now I'm ready to have a new voice and, and, and, and, and have some resolve. And I'm not doing the same old thing anymore. And I have some new compositions Prior to that, most of my albums were, I did a jazz album with, Greg Hurley and Brian Good. And that was more like an <span style="color:red" data-ts="2878.165" data-end_ts="2878.285" title="2878.165" id=c_"2878.165">__easy__</span> m thing where I just, I just played drums. And, there's a guy named Jim Combs who <span style="color:red" data-ts="2882.415" data-end_ts="2882.765" title="2882.415" id=c_"2882.415">__built__</span> by the name of Sensitive Chaos. And his album that he just did was, nominated for like one of the top 5:00 AM, electronic music albums in the country for the zone music reporter. And I got to play keys and percussion on, you know, five or six of the track. So normally I'm really centering on percussion, and now I'm, I'm getting back into the ambience a little bit, but I, I love percussion. I love playing, I love drums. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, when you're working with, when you're working with Synthesis now, what are, what are the tools you like using? What are the synths or software bits or whatever? What are the pieces that you like working with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I, I kind of went through this phase where, of course I got every soft synth known demand when they came out. And, you know, I played with Reactor and a couple other things. And I learned real quickly that I, I wanted to play synths and tweak synths, not build synths. So I, I, I never really, you know, I, I even tried having the Nord Modular. I had both of those, the G two and the original one, and I just never fell in love with them. And again, here's where I feel like the person who is coming at this completely from the opposite end, which is when I sit and talk with Mike Meley, you know, Mike's got an incredible knowledge of, you know, vintage analog since, because he's owned them, played them, used them, and had friends that owned them and played them and used them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, and a lot of the people my, our age, you know, came from that background modulars. I've never owned a modular. I don't understand modulars, yet. I've been a synthesist for 20 years. Go figure. 'cause I, my first synth was a DX seven. But as, as I've gone on, I've gotten bit by the analog bug huge. And I really don't enjoy soft <span style="color:red" data-ts="2979.605" data-end_ts="2979.845" title="2979.605" id=c_"2979.605">__sense__</span> anymore. I kind of put a little mor moratorium on myself that I don't use them when I play live. I will not use a computer on stage for any type of backing tracks. I, I don't understand Ableton. I've never used Ableton. I can't wrap my head around Ableton. I use my computer on stage as a mixer, which is strange. But I found if I go on stage with my computer and an eight channel or, or 10 channel interface, I can use that as my mixer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I can have the effects in the computer. So I have my reverbs on a, universal audio satellite card that, that handles my reverbs and a couple other effects. But really my computer's just being a mixer and a capturing tool. Right. But I'm running, my, my current rig is a mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="3019.145" data-end_ts="3019.365" title="3019.145" id=c_"3019.145">__mug__</span> Voyager that I bought from Nova Music back when you were still there. And that was the, the Solar Edition, which was an exclusive to them, which was basically an electric blue, but it was orange. So I still have that, which is probably my favorite synth. That's the one that when I sit down to play the Moog Modular, or I'm sorry, Moog Voyager is like an extension. That to me is an instrument. It's not a synth, it's an instrument. Right. I have a Dave Smith, prophet eight, not the, not the six, but I've got the, the Profit eight. And those are, that's my main rig for almost every show I've done for the past five years. Is, is those two. I have two digital syns left. I've, I've whittled down my whole synth collection. I, I have a, a Roland, it was the rack mount of the, the JD 800. So the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>JD nine 90. Yeah. I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I've got a JD nine 90 with the, with the vintage synth card in it that I love. And that's responsible for the sound of, I keep that, 'cause that, that really was the sound of like two module <span style="color:red" data-ts="3071.565" data-end_ts="3071.685" title="3071.565" id=c_"3071.565">__A__</span> albums, you know. And then I have a, a Yamaha <span style="color:red" data-ts="3074.705" data-end_ts="3074.925" title="3074.705" id=c_"3074.705">__Ex__</span> five, which what I loved about that was it was five kinds of synthesis crammed into one box. And I love virtual modeling. I love playing horn lines with a breath controller and things. And just, I, I allowed myself this past year, in the past 10 years, every time I made money with my studio, it went into compressors, EQs, microphone, preamps, better monitoring. I have not bought myself an instrument for probably a decade. And I just bought a pair of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3098.985" data-end_ts="3099.205" title="3098.985" id=c_"3098.985">__mug__</span> mother 30 twos to kind of gently dip my toe in the water of modular synthesis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, but I liked that they were self-contained. And I have an addictive personality, so my fear of getting into modular synthesis is I'd suddenly go broke. 'cause every month it would be just one more modular. Just one more module. I can do it. Just one more. You know. So the mothers are helping me learn modular synthesis, but it keeps it contained enough that I don't feel pressure to, to break outside of that. So that's my live rig. And then I use an eight channel looping device called, a looper <span style="color:red" data-ts="3129.865" data-end_ts="3130.085" title="3129.865" id=c_"3129.865">__of__</span> LP one, which is 8 16 8 stereo channels, of live realtime looping. And it's got like something crazy, like 10 minutes of looping time total divided up between that. And I, everything that you hear on stage if I play live is generated real time. So I'm, I'm inspired by Robert Fripp. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and people that basically would play it, you know, they, they'd play a sustained note and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="3150.765" data-end_ts="3150.885" title="3150.765" id=c_"3150.765">__it__</span> would loop back on itself and you'd kind of build up things that way. In that sense, I'm very old school. I don't, I don't do, I don't use loops or backing tracks. I don't capture things in a computer yet. I still work very organically and, you know, with, with analog gear primarily. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, I'll tell you, I, I have still like a hundred things I'd love to cover with you, but unfortunately our time is, we've blown through our time. This has been a fantastic chat and I really appreciate you taking you spending the time with us Now. One, one thing, one last question and I hope this is appropriate, but, the last time that we saw, we saw each other, you actually gave me some copies of the thing that you did with ufo. Yeah. So I didn't know that, that this person had passed away. Yeah. How do you deal with the loss of a collaborator in that way? Because 'cause the music you guys did was amazing. It has to, there has to be a personal sense of loss that you feel in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3215.305" data-end_ts="3215.525" title="3215.305" id=c_"3215.305">__in__</span> when that happens. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It's, it's, it's been weird 'cause Yes. You know, on one hand, you know, we, we work together. The, the way that collaboration started is I had an album on hypnosis. He had an album on hypnosis. And we both went, Hey, I dig your stuff. And he went, yeah, I, you know, I dig your stuff. It was, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3233.885" data-end_ts="3233.925" title="3233.885" id=c_"3233.885">__was__</span>, you know, kind of both of us at the same time going, wow, really cool. And so we decided to collaborate. So we did. And, it, it was very interesting 'cause he worked really old school. If I thought I was, I mean, he hates or hated computers. Everything he did was with sampling devices. So he would play and he would set, and he would record everything live to a CD recorder. So he would set up his whole performance and, and have all of his loops, all of his slow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>He would, he would spend months doing his sound design for a song, and then he would perform it as a performance of, you know, slowed down bells and chants and people talking and found sounds and synth patches that he created. And he would just, it was kind of this low <span style="color:red" data-ts="3273.165" data-end_ts="3273.445" title="3273.165" id=c_"3273.165">__five__</span>, but deep and cool kind of kind of thing. So he would do that and he just, you know, what he did with, for our first project was sent me a bunch of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3280.565" data-end_ts="3280.685" title="3280.565" id=c_"3280.565">__loop__</span> or sent me a bunch of passages. He's like, these aren't even songs yet. This is just sketches I'm doing. These are just sample food. This is, here's things. Take these and, and let's see what happens. And we, we actually planned, the sad thing is we had actually planned a third part of the, of Trilogy, and that was to never happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, and I think the hard thing was as we were working as, as we had finished up and just had the last album mastered, you know, he was saying things like, this might be the last album I ever do. And it, it turned out not to be, 'cause he had a couple other collaborations, you know, in the fire at the time. But it is certainly one of the last things he did. I think what's interesting is with any collaboration, what you hear on our albums is not his sound. And it's not my sound. So some of his longtime fans, the music was a bit too active for them because I tend to be very active in, in shifts and things moving around. Whereas his stuff is very much of the, you know, the, the, the European Drone School. And so he kind of pulled me more into the drone thing and I pulled him out of that into a more active thing, which by the time we got to our second album, he was actually very excited and, and in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3347.125" data-end_ts="3347.245" title="3347.125" id=c_"3347.125">__a__</span> sense sending me things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I didn't even know <span style="color:red" data-ts="3349.125" data-end_ts="3349.245" title="3349.125" id=c_"3349.125">__he__</span> was working on it. He took things that I had sent him that I'd forgotten about, and he sent me this stuff and he said, Hey, I took your stuff and I made it really kind of active and kind of cool and, you know, and so we, it went, you know, back and forth. And there was even a moment, I think with him where we were worried, you know, he's like, oh, is this too much change? Is it too, you know, but we, we put it out when, when I finally, you know, the thing is he died from cancer when he did finally pass away, it wasn't a shock. Right. You know, we, we knew it was coming and, you know, I'd gone to Italy and my wife and I spent time with him and his wife, and it was, you know, one of the greatest weeks of my life just hanging out with them because we didn't, they, they took off of work and he was a, he was actually a spinal surgeon, you know, for his day job, re removing, using lasers to remove cancerous tissue from people's spinal columns, you know, which, you know, there's an irony there. 
</p>

<b>Paul: </b>Even we spent just the whole week, we only ate out in restaurants, I think three times. You know, they, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3402.065" data-end_ts="3402.285" title="3402.065" id=c_"3402.065">__the__</span> just the whole lifestyle there, you know, they would go to the store every morning, pick up food, and, and we'd go back home and we'd eat, you know, and then they'd take <span style="color:red" data-ts="3409.245" data-end_ts="3409.405" title="3409.245" id=c_"3409.245">__us__</span> sightseeing to outta the way places. We went to Rome once and that was it. And we didn't even do music together. We just listened. We listened to each other's stuff, made plans and notes and, and things. And then went back home and, and this was before the internet really, yet. Yeah, there was internet, but it was, you know, still there. There wasn't high speed data transfers. So we're sending disks to each other in the mail, hoping that with the Italian postal service, you know, he'd always tell me, he's like, well, I sent some stuff out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>We'll see if it gets you. And one time it took, it took three months, and he was, he was worried. I mean, because again, he didn't make copies of this stuff. He just created it and sent it. It's like, he's like, I'm starting to get depressed. I don't think it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3447.405" data-end_ts="3447.525" title="3447.405" id=c_"3447.405">__going__</span> to, you know, so it was, it was sad when he, when he passed away, because I, you know, again, it was a musical collaborator. You know, I, I can't say, you know, that we were, you know, best friends. I, I mean, this was somebody I collaborated with. We didn't talk every day. What I mean, I mean, we were friends, but it wasn't like Chris, where I talked to him regularly and we know what's going on in each other's lives. This was more like once or twice a year. Like, Hey man, hey Gigi, how's it going? What's going on? Hey, you know, that, that type of thing. So I, I think of the weird thing is I actually, when I think of the albums and the music, it actually takes me a second to remind myself that he's, he's gone. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3479.625" data-end_ts="3479.845" title="3479.625" id=c_"3479.625">__So__</span> I don't actively think about him not being here. It's more of a, you know, I actually have to remind myself, if that makes sense.

<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Paul, thank you so much for taking the time outta your schedule and, and talking with me. It's fascinating to go over this stuff. We're gonna have to get together again and talk some more because there's so much more I'd like to ask about. But, I, I do hope I look forward to your, next, your next release. This sounds great. And where is the best place for people to go and hear, your work both as modulate as well as your solo work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah, that's the one area where I'm really light on. I don't have a website yet, <laugh>, strangely enough. So I think the jazz album that I did is on iTunes, that's, that's under Greg Hurley <span style="color:red" data-ts="3533.605" data-end_ts="3533.725" title="3533.605" id=c_"3533.605">__vin__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3533.725" data-end_ts="3533.885" title="3533.725" id=c_"3533.725">__Up__</span>, Brian. Good. I'm not sure the Greg Hurley's first. So if you type in Greg Hurley, you'll find the album that was called The Moss Garden Sessions. I do know that Chris Short has a couple <span style="color:red" data-ts="3542.015" data-end_ts="3542.365" title="3542.015" id=c_"3542.015">__molet__</span> albums up at his band camp page, which I think is just Christopher Short at Band Camp, or I'm probably got getting that wrong. You can go to the Hypnos website. They do have sound samples of some of the albums <span style="color:red" data-ts="3552.315" data-end_ts="3552.605" title="3552.315" id=c_"3552.315">__that__</span>, unfortunately, there are a couple albums of ours that are on <span style="color:red" data-ts="3554.645" data-end_ts="3554.765" title="3554.645" id=c_"3554.645">__a__</span> print, but I think Chris has them up on Bandcamp now. So it, it's a little convoluted, but they're out there. And when we get the new album finished, I hope to rectify all that. I've got a person who's gonna help me put together a website finally, and kind of go from there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, you gotta pick up the chisels man. And it's, I know <laugh>. Alright, well thank you so much and it's great talking to you. We'll catch you later man. Thanks. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3578.795" data-end_ts="3579.285" title="3578.795" id=c_"3578.795">__Alright__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Bye.
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Paul for doing this on short notice. He kinda helped me out of buying this weekend. It's huge props to him. Dude's got an interesting story and it does some amazing music. So if you haven't checked it out yet, you really need to do it. Thanks to all listeners out there, thanks to friends at places like opia that <span style="color:red" data-ts="3607.165" data-end_ts="3607.285" title="3607.165" id=c_"3607.165">__helped__</span> spread the word. And, thanks to you for spreading the words as well. Catch you next week.
