<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great fortune of getting a chance to talk to Eric Rodent Chela. We're gonna just call him Rodent because that's his artist's name. That's how an awful lot of people know him. And, so we'll just go with that. So, hey, rodent, how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric 'Rodent' Cheslak: </b>It's going good, Darwin. Thanks. Thanks for having me on your show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hey, thanks a lot for taking the time outta your schedule to do this. I really appreciate it. Now, I know you mostly, well, I, I got to, got the introduction to you from Bonna Hoffer, but, I know of you through your work with the Modular on the Spot stuff, but, as I went digging around, I ran across an awful lot of music and an awful lot of like, pretty dark and interesting music. Why don't you tell me a little bit about what your, what you think is your work, right? It'd be better for you to tell me than me to guess. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Well, describe your music. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="74.785" data-end_ts="75.005" title="74.785" id=c_"74.785">__try__</span>, you know what, I try to, I try to really do a lot of different things all the time. Like, or just not the same style, like all the time. It's definitely all made on the URAC Modular Sense system these days. And I guess preliminary preliminarily, I'd like to say I'm trying to make music these days that gives no nods to typical everyday music, rock and roll rap, r and b, any of that. I, I seriously strive to make music that gives no nods to that at all. I think it's time that we move past all that stuff. Sure. So with that, with that being said, I don't know. I mean, I like, I like darker music and I don't know, I guess that's kind of, some people have asked me before as well, like, do you only make dark music? Well, <laugh> I don't know. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="135.425" data-end_ts="135.545" title="135.425" id=c_"135.425">__just__</span>, I, I make music and that what, that's what comes out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's interesting that you say that you're trying to avoid, like, giving a nod to other music. 'cause it is, I would say that what you're doing is really unique. And the other thing that I like is, unlike a lot of music that modular heads are making, 'cause you know, there's, there is sort of like this kind of stock, you know, highly rhythmic, really noisy sourced music. Right. But yours has kind of, your stuff kind of fits in a different spot. And it, because it's got some melody, but it's not what I would call melodic music. And it's got like, kind of a dark texture, but it's not what I would call cinematic. So it seems to sort of like <laugh> kinda like slip through the slots of a lot of, a lot of genres, which is kind of cool. And it makes it pretty interesting to listen to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Well, thanks. I I like that. I don't know, I, I like to say that, that my system helps me make the music. Yeah. I like to think of myself as, as the conductor of the symphony of all these modules in my modular system, because so many of 'em are so unique and very playable and made by all these really rad brainiac engineers that I've been lucky enough to become friends with several of 'em over the past few years. And I don't know, I, I, I feel like my interaction with all of these modules in my system, that's, that's part of the creation process that how my music comes out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. You know, that's, that's actually interesting point. I've never really thought about it that way. But there's lots, I mean, the thing that's kind of unique about, about working with a modular system that's like maybe different than if you're a guitar player or a saxophone player, is that you sort of come to know your instrument a little piece at a time. Right. So it's not like with a guitar, you're like, oh, I'm gonna get a neck and I'm gonna play the neck for a while and then I'm gonna get some strings. Right. Yeah. But with a modular, you kind of, you start off with some pieces and then you're like, Hmm, I feel the need for this other thing. And your set of pieces are almost always gonna be completely different from someone else's. So yeah, by definition it's gonna be your kind of unique creation and the way you come to learn it is gonna be unique too. I didn't think about it that way, but that's kind of cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>I like, I like to think about it like that sometimes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So I would say that, you know, talking about the music of yours that I've heard, I, I would say that it has a really, it has a really unique voice. One of the things I like doing on my podcast is kind of find out how people come to get their artistic voice. Right. Where does it come from? How did they grow up? What other arts or what other things were they into that might've influenced 'em over time? What's sort of your beginner story? What is, what does the start of your story look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Well, the start of my story was in the early nineties getting my first drum machine. It was a rowing <span style="color:red" data-ts="338.005" data-end_ts="338.125" title="338.005" id=c_"338.005">__to__</span> R five. You got a Cassio, a CZ 1 0 1 after that for a little while. Just some pedal, some pedals on <span style="color:red" data-ts="345.565" data-end_ts="345.685" title="345.565" id=c_"345.565">__the__</span> guitar. And you know, I've, I've always tried to learn how to play guitar. I still can't play Guitar Man <laugh>. I could have dedicated five years of my life to learn how to play guitar. And I, I couldn't do it. And it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="358.045" data-end_ts="358.125" title="358.045" id=c_"358.045">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="358.125" data-end_ts="358.245" title="358.125" id=c_"358.125">__rea__</span>, one of the reasons why I don't play guitar today is, you know what? I'm just not into the way guitar sounds. I think Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like, there's, I listen, I do listen to a lot of guitar music. Some of my favorite post punk and goth stuff, rock and roll stuff, or punk and hardcore stuff from when I was a kid is like all guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="376.805" data-end_ts="377.085" title="376.805" id=c_"376.805">__based__</span> music, because that's what I knew right as music growing up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>But unless it's me listening to one of those old favorites these days, I don't listen to guitar music really at all. And I'm not, and I'm not saying that I listen to Trap right now, either <laugh>, but I don't really listen to guitar music or, or I guess popular music these days really at all. Sometimes when I'm riding around in my cart, I find myself listening to my own tracks to like, Hey, do I like this? Do I wanna put this on my SoundCloud? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, should I save this for my next tape or cd? Like, I feel like I'm going through tracks in my car as I'm like, whether I'm like driving to go meet up with dudes to shoot a photo or something. And I don't know. But I guess back to my, back to my start, after I realized that I was really interested in making music and making electronic music, I started taking recording studio and engineering classes at Northern Virginia Community College. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>I grew up just outside of Washington DC in Fairfax County. So I went to Northern Virginia Community College, and the first time I walked in <span style="color:red" data-ts="456.325" data-end_ts="456.405" title="456.325" id=c_"456.325">__the__</span> recording studio, I looked in the vocal booth and that was also the synth room. And I was like, whoa, what is that thing? And it was an <span style="color:red" data-ts="463.245" data-end_ts="463.405" title="463.245" id=c_"463.245">__Arc__</span> 2,600. <span style="color:red" data-ts="464.505" data-end_ts="464.725" title="464.505" id=c_"464.505">__Oh__</span>. And they had that in a Juno 1 0 6 and a DX seven. So it was a really good small solution of enough to completely freak my brain out. Right. And, I spent more time in that synth lab than probably anybody else who was taking those classes at the time and was trying to get my hands on more synthesizers and different drum machines. And, but what it also did too is it helped me learn some of the recording process. <span style="color:red" data-ts="496.025" data-end_ts="496.245" title="496.025" id=c_"496.025">__And__</span> I mean, we were actually doing stuff on tape back then. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="498.965" data-end_ts="499.125" title="498.965" id=c_"498.965">__mean__</span> Right. Which, like I said, was, this was the early nineties, so Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. The digital audio workstation was, not very happening at that point. It was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was a dream at that point. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Yeah. It was a, it was a dream. And, and what they had then now is more than a dinosaur. Right. So, I don't know. That was kind like my jumpstart. And then from there it was just kinda collecting new synthesizers. And that's when I probably making music then and not even putting the guitar into it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I was really into like industrial stuff back then, and that was like heavy electronics with guitar, you know, heavy guitar riffs thrown in, you know, in different places and, you know, over, over the whole thing. And then it was like, after a while I realized like, I'm not even putting guitar in stuff I'm making. Right. Like, I was just like, you know what? I don't see the need for it. And then I kind of, I don't know, shunned out <span style="color:red" data-ts="555.165" data-end_ts="555.325" title="555.165" id=c_"555.165">__on__</span>, I've gone back and forth with guitar like five different times since like, wanting to learn it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>And, and, and then now finally I'm completely like, hands off even though I try to get bandana to play more bass. It's really funny that said, I'll listen to some of my old <span style="color:red" data-ts="572.725" data-end_ts="572.925" title="572.725" id=c_"572.725">__post__</span> punk favorites. Yeah. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="574.605" data-end_ts="574.805" title="574.605" id=c_"574.605">__asked__</span> her like, Hey, can you play this <span style="color:red" data-ts="576.285" data-end_ts="576.605" title="576.285" id=c_"576.285">__baseline__</span> <laugh>? And then her eyes roll <span style="color:red" data-ts="578.305" data-end_ts="578.525" title="578.305" id=c_"578.305">__and__</span> her man, come on, this is like an eighth grade level baseline. Right. It's like, dude, this is Sister's of Mercy. What are you talking about <laugh>? So, I don't know, I guess I could say that what's really affected the music that I make and my start was the music that I've always listened to that I found really inspiring and stuff that shaped me early on. 'cause that was just like a bunch of heavy metal and hardcore and punk and stuff. But it was like when I got introduced to <span style="color:red" data-ts="613.785" data-end_ts="614.005" title="613.785" id=c_"613.785">__the__</span> Guinea Puppy and Frontline Assembly and Front 2 4 2 mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b><affirmative>, like Depeche Mode Ministry, a lot of like wax <span style="color:red" data-ts="625.245" data-end_ts="625.525" title="625.245" id=c_"625.245">__track__</span> stuff. That was like late eighties, early nineties. And then like during those times, like I found like Cabaret Voltaire and then I found Throbbing Grisel and started kind of to look at noise music a little bit more, or just a lot noisier stuff. And I don't know, stuff like <span style="color:red" data-ts="643.735" data-end_ts="644.085" title="643.735" id=c_"643.735">__noise__</span> bout I guess like all like the OG industrial stuff was like really heavy on me, really pertinent to me seeing music in a completely different way. Like, I remember hearing like <span style="color:red" data-ts="656.085" data-end_ts="656.325" title="656.085" id=c_"656.085">__bout__</span> tracks and thinking like, man, what is this? These dudes are playing. And then when I finally saw photos Yeah. And I was like blown away. I was like, whoa, these dudes just gathered up and just stuff that would, that would work. That wasn't a traditional instrument. Right. And that was kind of a, that was kind of a revelation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>And then, then I started to hear like the artificial intelligence compilations that, right. I think it was wax tracks and war or something <span style="color:red" data-ts="686.725" data-end_ts="686.925" title="686.725" id=c_"686.725">__was__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="686.925" data-end_ts="687.165" title="686.925" id=c_"686.925">__were__</span> putting out. And then that was where like, I got turned <span style="color:red" data-ts="690.305" data-end_ts="690.525" title="690.305" id=c_"690.305">__on__</span> to Aer Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and started to really follow them. And then the stuff that they were putting out in like 98, that, that got me really into like more abstract sound composition stuff. And at this time, you know, this is still pre-internet where you can't just be like, oh, I want to hear what, you know, know what Pierre Schafer was doing, you know, tape music wise. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, I hadn't never even really heard of any of that stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting to me because it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="721.685" data-end_ts="721.845" title="721.685" id=c_"721.685">__so__</span>, the, the path that you carved out actually is really similar to my path. And, and the way it is, is is that, you know, especially kind of like coming from industrial and I just think that there were like touchstones all along the way. So I remember in industrial, back when I was really into it, and the first time I heard, I think it was hijab or somebody like that, and it was like, oh my God, they don't even have any freaking guitars on this whole thing. How can that possibly be? You know? But then you had someone like front 2, 4 2 who comes along and sort of says, we're gonna take some of the beats from this thing. We're gonna take some of the angry sound from that thing. And, and it melds and it sort of like draws you. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="768.845" data-end_ts="768.965" title="768.845" id=c_"768.845">__a__</span> attacker was another one where it sort of like drew you in. 'cause it had the beat and it had Simon an angry sound, but it also had this really abstract quality and kind of that path is one that I think, I mean, you, you took, I feel like I took that path, but I seem to know a lot of people that did too. It was like these kind of touchstone artists that just sort of said, take what you think of now and imagine another step added to it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Yeah, for sure. And it was like a attacker that got me into doing like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="800.715" data-end_ts="801.005" title="800.715" id=c_"800.715">__each__</span>, that weren't like, I wanna say linear, you know, that were just constantly changing, constantly evolving and, and random, random beat generation stuff. But then there's like, oh, what is it? It's EP seven, the last track on it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, or maybe it's the last track on LP five. Like it's really, it's called, I think it's called Drain Two or something. And I, man, I've probably listened to that track 10,000 times, like <laugh> just, but what it was was it got me starting to think about the avantgarde and starting to like look for like the avantgarde of stuff that just <span style="color:red" data-ts="841.985" data-end_ts="842.205" title="841.985" id=c_"841.985">__Tam__</span> shifted through time and rhythm and melody like wasn't a factor at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>I don't know today, that's how I start. A lot of my tracks that I make is like, there's, there's no rhythm or melody. Like I don't start off by writing a melody and Oh, I'm just gonna build on this melody. I start off with, with sounds that <span style="color:red" data-ts="865.105" data-end_ts="865.325" title="865.105" id=c_"865.105">__tam__</span> shift through time and not based on any kind of like time signature. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See that's almost like backwards of how a lot of people work. A lot of people like lay down their equivalent of a rhythm section and then sort of like scorch over the top of it. But you say that you start off with that, with that sound and then figure out what you, if you even want to add things later Yeah. Do it later. You'll worry about it later. Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Yeah. The drums and stuff like that and like percussion type sound. That's all, that's like some of the last stuff that I'm filling in. I'm, I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Interesting. I'm trying to move several different sounds through the stereo field and <span style="color:red" data-ts="909.785" data-end_ts="910.205" title="909.785" id=c_"909.785">__timber__</span> shifting and Sure. There's some pitch changes and stuff in it too. But yeah, I mean that that, that's, that's normally where I start with making my stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. But that, you know what too that makes, so then doing sort of like the linear ever changing rhythm tracks and stuff, it's, it's a little easier to cope with that because then you're thinking of that as kind of like intertwining with your longer form Tamil changes instead of, you know, they have to stand alone because they're the first track that you laid down. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I get that. That's a really interesting, so how do you take this concept? I mean, you're known for the modular on spot thing, which is basically a, it's live B no computers invited, thank you. And c pretty much running along a river brain riverbank somewhere. Right. How do you take this, like this concept and, and sort of like your audio quality which is kind of heavy and affected and stuff like that. How do you take that into a performance environment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Well, I, it's, that's a good question. And, and I kind of just try to do the best I can <laugh> with just adapting that into a smaller system, you know? 'cause I have a pretty decent sized system at home. And then what I do is I'll start the ideas here on the big system and then I'll kind of just extract what modules I was using and try to put 'em into a smaller case that I can take down to the river or wherever, you know, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1007.645" data-end_ts="1007.965" title="1007.645" id=c_"1007.645">__module__</span> on the spot's gonna be. We just did some over the winter here in LA when we had all the rains, we did some at a really cool little outdoor cafe that sits along the LA river. 'cause where we normally do 'em down in the river, just the water levels were up <span style="color:red" data-ts="1021.885" data-end_ts="1022.045" title="1021.885" id=c_"1021.885">__just__</span> underwater up and down and <laugh>, we just didn't want to deal with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>So we did like a few months of 'em at this cafe and mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it was, and they were actually really cool. It's a little setting that that still really agrees with what mod on the spot is. And I don't know how I, how I adapt it to like live. I try to just get it into a small case and really try to make the most of what I'm taking, but with a focus direction towards the idea I had in the first place for like, the composition. You know, the, the past year or so, I've been really getting into idealizing small, multiple brand URAC systems that focus towards a specific, a specific patch or a specific piece or a specific composition where the system is, they're always like really unique. Like some of 'em have been something where it's like a modular, really playable jammable groove box. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And some of 'em have been just for ambient or then some of 'em have been for acid techno or some of 'em been like, you know, we had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1099.725" data-end_ts="1099.925" title="1099.725" id=c_"1099.725">__mod__</span> on the spot last night and I, I did a piece that was definitely granular madness, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>It was, total exploration. But you know, or then some of 'em are configured to be like, what I would take for like our small tours I'll do where I'm trying to, to get like 5, 6, 7 different completely different sounding sections of, of a show outta my system. And that's where you kinda really gotta milk this stuff to have some totally different sounding sections and different sounding rhythms and I don't know. Yeah. Trying to, trying to make the most of it. I i trying to make the most of it, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, let's, let's talk a little bit about this though, because this idea of, so I, I only have a small system just because for me, I went, I went haywire and then I was like, oh man, when I had too many modules and too big of a system, I, I live too much in like a collector's mode, right. And I was like, oh shit, I don't wanna spend all my time like searching muff wiggler for, you know, another, another pingable event generator so that I have the right Yeah. Quadruple set right. Or something like that, whatever. So I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1181.405" data-end_ts="1181.605" title="1181.405" id=c_"1181.405">__ended__</span> up pairing back to this really small system and I find it really freeing to work with that, but it, it ended up kind of becoming purpose built for how I think of playing. Right Now you're talking about building purpose, purpose-built systems almost based on your mood for a specific day is what it kind of sounds like or the mood that a, a, a compositional idea might take you, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Yeah. Or for a specific Yeah. Or for a specific composition. Or sometimes it's just a challenge of like, Hey, what can I get in a nine new system that's like 84 HP wide, right? What can I get in this one system and get the most out of it and be able to do like a whole full show and be able to have something that is really playable, really jammable? I don't know. That's, that's kind of what I, that's like a puzzle that I try to think about all the time is like new little system configurations and Got it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1244.725" data-end_ts="1245.005" title="1244.725" id=c_"1244.725">__Module__</span> on the spot is such a great thing for that because you technically are performing, but you know what, it's a picnic <laugh>. It's not a, it's, it's, it's a, it's not a club show, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>It's not a serious, serious atmosphere. It's not supposed to be it's community. It's a hangout, it's a picnic. You know, some people show up with like 18 U and even more and it's like, oh man, I would imagine that all the work you put into that, why wouldn't you just like, get yourself, why wouldn't you just book a club gig, right. And play that at club gig. Like, Hey, you can come down here with Nine U and just noodle out and like, do something cool and fun with that. And it's like the same thing. You know, some people really take it really seriously. Right. And I'm trying to get the message out there to, to like, hey, it doesn't have to be that serious <laugh>. Like, if you wanna take it serious like that. Okay, cool. Well I'm gonna take something serious like that. That's like from like my tours and like club gigs and like Moog Fest and stuff like that. Not like, you know, like I said, we had one last night and I did this granular exploration. I put the system together yesterday and built the patch in like 20 minutes and was like, okay, we gotta load the car. Let's go. It was like really on the spot kind of Right. Just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Literally 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Just did it. Yeah. Did it, did it on the fly. And it was, and it was an idea that I had for using a bunch of certain modules together in one small six, seven <span style="color:red" data-ts="1341.025" data-end_ts="1341.245" title="1341.025" id=c_"1341.025">__use__</span> system. Modular on the Spot is such a great place for people to come and check out modular <span style="color:red" data-ts="1348.205" data-end_ts="1348.485" title="1348.205" id=c_"1348.205">__sense__</span> stuff or if you're playing to just try out some ideas. It doesn't have to be the totally refined idea. You can just try out ideas. It's a cool, fully open whatever you want it to be kind of thing. Well it's, that's what's awesome 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>About it. Yeah. I'll tell you, I have talked to a number of people and just, you know, some of my friends have performed at the Modular Spot things, and one of the thing everyone talks about is sort of the laid back aspect of it as being very different, you know, either from gigs, from typical gigs or from sort of the synth nerd gatherings that sometimes happen, right? I mean, yeah, the synth chasms or whatever you wanna call them. <laugh>, you know, because in those cases it's like, well, I have to make sure that I have the largest collection of, you know, viable gear to somehow prove, you know, my, in most cases to prove my masculinity. Right. And, that's kind of specific, not specifically not what the modular to Spot does. And that's one of the things that a lot of people point to as being particularly cool about it. It it really is a hangout. It really is about something where everyone's very supportive of one another and supportive of people experimenting with where they're going. And that's pretty cool. Yeah. That's, that's pretty rare in any kind of performing situation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Sure. And the other thing too is like if you've been to him, it's like, Hey, and you have a modular, come do something. We've had so many people like, Hey, this is my first time I'm ever playing with my modular almost in a performance kind of thing right in front of people. It's like people's, like first show ever. I mean actually Tony Rolando played his first show ever at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1463.925" data-end_ts="1464.085" title="1463.925" id=c_"1463.925">__er__</span> on the spot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hey, you know what? That actually came up. I was on a panel with him, at Berkeley College of Music, was it last weekend? No, it was weekend before last. And, we were talking about performances and stuff and he mentioned that his first, his first live performance ever was, was swinging out there and, you know, trying to come up with something. And it was, he talked about it as being such a beautiful experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>We were, we were really excited to have Tony out here. And then we didn't even know until it was like that day or like the day before. He was like, dude, I've never played with, I've never played with one of my systems. Like I've never done a live show, you know? And, and I still am reluctant. I'm like thinking to myself like, while I'm saying that like live show, it's like, it's at a, it's a picnic though. It's like it's, yeah, you're, you're performing, I guess you're, you're playing a piece of music that you're making in front of other people. But that blew my mind. I was like, wait, Tony, you've never played a show with this stuff. Like, you've been making this stuff forever and make awesome stuff. Like, whoa, wait a minute. So he was like so nervous and I had to like calm him down and be like, Tony, you gotta chill dude. <laugh>, it's a picnic. Don't worry about it. You'll be fine. He was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1547.965" data-end_ts="1548.165" title="1547.965" id=c_"1547.965">__oh__</span> man, this sucks. I'm like, man, no way dude. You're fine. There's no judgments, man. If, you know, if you make some obvious screw ups, who cares? Right? It's a picnic and it's like the, just the community hanging out. It doesn't have the, doesn't have the stuffy vibe of, of like a club show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, in fact, fact, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>You know, and that's what we wanted. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. One of the things I would say in that kind of environment, it's, it's unlike a club show because if you screw up the people listening instead of saying, oh, that was a fuck up, they're more likely to say, oh, I remember that happened to me once. And you know, it like starts a conversation instead of being an embarrassment. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>For sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, it's pretty hilarious. Well, now I'm curious, we were talking before a little bit about the guitar and how you don't really listen to guitar music and that's like a whole conversation because I'm not even sure there is, I don't know that there is anything that's like modern guitar music. Everything I hear is like some sort of nostalgic version of what guitar used to be at some period in time. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>That is correct. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But one of the things I would say is that a lot of the music that people working with modulars are, doesn't really have that kind of, I mean, there are a few people that are trying to do Silver Apples of the Moon or are trying to kind of do the, you know, do the ULA bongos yet again or whatever, but for the most part people or are trying to do like the equivalent of a sh 1 0 1 arpeggiator. Right. But for, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Well I hear that at times, but I hear a lot of people trying to do like the Robert Rich and trying to do a lot of like big spatial, you know, kind of ambient kind of new age stuff. Oh, right. Sure. I've, I've been hearing a lot more and more of that lately is I've been seeing and hearing a lot more of this, I guess around la I've been hearing a lot more of that lately. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, I was gonna ask you a little bit about what you're seeing emerging from, 'cause you probably more than anybody else have the opportunity to see what, what people are coming up with like in their basement laboratories, right. <laugh>, you know, as they're putting together little systems and getting the right effects and all that stuff. Probably some of the first place they're showing that work is that the mod on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1711.955" data-end_ts="1712.075" title="1711.955" id=c_"1711.955">__the__</span> spot gigs. Right. And what do you think, what do you see in general and what do you see that is kind of a trap for people? Because I think that modular has some kind of obvious traps, but I'm curious to see what hear what you think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Well, I think the Traps kind come in with people kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1737.365" data-end_ts="1737.715" title="1737.365" id=c_"1737.365">__doing__</span> something at maybe one of the other <span style="color:red" data-ts="1739.355" data-end_ts="1739.635" title="1739.355" id=c_"1739.355">__module__</span> on the spots or, you know, at another like, you know, modular show or something and be like, oh, I wanna do something. I wanna incorporate like that kind of thing into like what I'm doing. Or like, oh, I want that sound and, and like what I'm doing. Or like, oh, I want those rhythms and like, you know, what I'm doing. Where that's the trap. 'cause then you're, you're that, that's the same thing that's going on in in Guitar World. It's like people are just like, oh, I wanna do, I wanna do that. You know? And it's like, well hey, you know what? Like explore this stuff deeply and do what you really want to do. Like what, you know, explore this stuff deeply and bring out what's really in you and not what you hear from other people that you think is is cool sounding right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>You know, if you explore this stuff deeply and bring out what is in you, you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1809.455" data-end_ts="1809.535" title="1809.455" id=c_"1809.455">__gonna__</span> bring out something cool sounding and that's where the rest of us are gonna be like, whoa, shit. That was amazing. But what's some of the stuff that I've been hearing lately that, I'll say this basic and it, it wasn't at Mod on the spot, but it was on this, little west coast tour that I just did. And we, we're at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1835.915" data-end_ts="1836.265" title="1835.915" id=c_"1835.915">__synth__</span> meet in Portland and I played the show, Bana played the show. Tyler from WMD played the show and Basic played the show. Well, basic Rock <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.525" data-end_ts="1848.745" title="1848.525" id=c_"1848.525">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.805" data-end_ts="1849.025" title="1848.805" id=c_"1848.805">__Six__</span> U mm-Hmm. And played one of the most amazing Euro sets I've ever heard. Really? And it was in his style of, of beets to avant garde, just digital timber shifting noodles to, to break core just super heavy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>But I don't think I've ever seen anybody <span style="color:red" data-ts="1881.315" data-end_ts="1881.665" title="1881.315" id=c_"1881.315">__juice__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1881.805" data-end_ts="1882.025" title="1881.805" id=c_"1881.805">__to__</span> six You like that before <laugh> ever <laugh>. Wow. I I don't, I don't think that that's really, really been done on that kind of level before with not, I mean, and he had like no, I I don't think he, he had any like, sample playback modules in there or, or maybe he had a cubit wave in there. I can't remember what, what all was set up, but it was like, man, it was like that Six U was like a wet sponge and he literally rung every drop out of it <laugh>. And it was, and it was amazing. And I mean, he played for like almost an hour 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Off of a six <span style="color:red" data-ts="1925.905" data-end_ts="1926.025" title="1925.905" id=c_"1925.905">__U__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>40 Wow. 45 minutes and almost like 45, 50 minutes. Like, wow, dude with an encore. We were all screaming at the top of our lungs. It was amazing. And I mean, I don't know, there's, I'm trying to think of other stuff that I've kind of heard lately that that's kind of came out that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1948.315" data-end_ts="1948.435" title="1948.315" id=c_"1948.315">__I__</span> kinda really, really caught my eye. You know, Mike Doebler's another guy that really, that really squeezes every ounce out of like a six U and, and does really abstract, really just, I don't know, avant garde kind of stuff that breaks into like rhythmic kind of beat sections and stuff. And, and he's really good and I've always enjoyed his stuff. And that dude starts his sets with no patch cables in his system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>And builds the patch live on the fly. And you know what, that blows my mind every time. <laugh>, it seriously blows my mind every time. I think we were talking about, I think we're gonna have a module on the spot coming up that everybody starts No patch cables. Right. Then what happens is what happens, we have to start <span style="color:red" data-ts="2004.605" data-end_ts="2004.765" title="2004.605" id=c_"2004.605">__an__</span> empty, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2005.565" data-end_ts="2005.685" title="2005.565" id=c_"2005.565">__an__</span> empty slate module on the spot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>I think that would be, that would be a really good one. But I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2012.205" data-end_ts="2012.245" title="2012.205" id=c_"2012.205">__know__</span>. I really like Mike's stuff. Trying to think who else that really, really has stood out lately. Anthony Baldino always blows my mind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I just talked to him, I just interviewed him like two days ago. He's, he's amazing Cat, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>A really, really good friend of ours and he is like the unsung hero of like, of this stuff man. He really is. He blows my mind every time and it's like so low key about it that I started getting booked for shows and I was like, Hey, I'll only play the show if Anthony can play it too <laugh> because I gotta like get this dude out more and like have some people hear some of his music. 'cause he is like the underground unsung hero of the stuff. The stuff that he makes is like so next level and refined that I don't know. And like him and Mike and, and basic, these are all like my good friends. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. It's like, this is like our scene here in town and like Ted Butler <span style="color:red" data-ts="2075.545" data-end_ts="2075.765" title="2075.545" id=c_"2075.545">__BNA__</span> as well, you know, the Cubic guys are here in town. Steven McCall lives right down the street. He's in town. You know, so many other people. Tom Hall, like we got a really good scene here in town. I'm like, these are all our friends that were around all the time. It's unique now. Now this is making me think I need to be shooting more photos of it all the time, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, well, I was gonna ask, first of all, I mean people outside of LA are starting to joke about there being sort of like an LA modular mafia, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.025" data-end_ts="2106.245" title="2106.025" id=c_"2106.025">__So__</span> you guys <laugh>, wow, you do stuff together, you talk about each other's work and stuff like that and it's kind of fun and funny. What I wonder is to what extent did the modular bring you guys together and to what extent was it that you, you liked each other and turned each other onto modulars? Which came first? The modulars or the friends? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>I think it was, we were all into modulars but none of us knew each other. Like Derek knew Mike and then Steven just started making stuff. I mean Steven's only had noise engineering for like, you know, like four years or something. Yeah, right. There was a bunch of us were still all like hiding in our bedrooms with our systems <laugh>. Derek was like kind of just getting into modular and using it 'cause he was more of like a temp, you know, doing stuff with Tempest and drum machines and stuff. Right. I'm trying to think what it was that kind of brought us all, you know, you know, who brought us all together. Actually, I think about it and I gotta shout this dude out and he is done more for me and so many of us in our LA modular scene is Cyrus Rex. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> Cyrus <span style="color:red" data-ts="2174.605" data-end_ts="2174.765" title="2174.605" id=c_"2174.605">__Rex__</span> would be a great, great person for you to talk to too. Right. That dude brought all of us together. Interesting. I know all these dudes through Cyrus. Rex, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What did he do to introduce him to you? Did he have like get togethers or did he just say, Hey, here's someone to talk to? He 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Has a massive modular, right. And he would always, like, when I invited him, he was like, you know, I had like a six U and he was like, Hey, come over. I have a bunch of modular stuff. Like just if he gets a good vibe from you that like, you know, you're not gonna come over and trash his place 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>It's like he's very open to have to meet new people and have 'em over and, and get to know them and like I learned so much from him. And then when we started doing the Muff Wiggler site together and running the Muff <span style="color:red" data-ts="2225.125" data-end_ts="2225.485" title="2225.125" id=c_"2225.125">__Wiggler__</span> store and doing those Muff Wiggler events, making all those videos that were on the Muff <span style="color:red" data-ts="2230.925" data-end_ts="2231.325" title="2230.925" id=c_"2230.925">__Wiggler__</span> Vimeo and site, I got to know Cyrus really well and he really is a super good friend. He's an amazing person. And then all these people would be coming over where we were like, Hey, let's do some artist interviews. And he is like, oh man, I know this dude Mike, we gotta interview him. Mike Dobler. And it was like, that was how I met Mike. And then like we were doing stuff here and like we started to do some stuff in town and then like Ed <span style="color:red" data-ts="2259.135" data-end_ts="2259.485" title="2259.135" id=c_"2259.135">__Janis__</span> started to like tag us in on post and we got to know GED really well and we went and did an interview with GED and Derek was like hanging out with us the whole time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Or like Andrew Felix, I kind of met through him but met through going to Analog Haven. Yeah. I guess we do have quite a, quite a scene here. Some people have said that we have the best scene. Tony Rolando was saying that he thought that we have the best scene in the United States and I don't know, I still look at the scene in New York and I'm like, oh wow. Like all the raddest dudes are there, you know, like, Rob Lowe's in New York, you know, but I don't know, we have a lot of, we have a lot of people out here. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2301.605" data-end_ts="2301.725" title="2301.605" id=c_"2301.605">__I__</span> I try to think about it like, our scene's better than yours. I don't, I don't ever think about it like that. It's just like, hey, we're just doing what we do and it's like our friends like all hanging out. And then it was like, that was how we met bna was, was we took a demo table to a I dream of wire screening and she showed up and 'cause she was interested in modulars and just got a voyager and found out what a ULA was and was like, oh, they're screening this movie. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>I gotta go see this <laugh>. That was how Cyrus and I met her. Unreal. She showed up to the movie and then just became, we welcomed her in and she became part of our crew. Right. You know, there is, there's plenty of people like that, you know, like Tom was already out here, but you know, he started coming to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2346.875" data-end_ts="2347.165" title="2346.875" id=c_"2346.875">__Mara__</span> on the spot and we got to know him and it was like, wow, there's so many people that people that came to on the spot that were like, you know what, this is really cool. I wanna build a system and learn how to make music with a system like this. And I wanna play at Mod on the spot. There's a guy, Andrew, that played at <span style="color:red" data-ts="2363.205" data-end_ts="2363.365" title="2363.205" id=c_"2363.205">__Mod__</span> on the spot last night that a year and a half ago he was coming over to my house to like research what modules he wanted to buy and start to build a system. And he played in a, a really awesome set last night. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>We're seeing new people get into this. We're seeing people play their first shows or play their first piece for other people. Yeah. We're seeing we're we're seeing it grow. Well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And you know what's, what's funny is that the way that that it's the excitement that people talk about it and the way that this thing is growing and stuff like that. It's funny because it doesn't feel like a music thing. It feels almost like a religion thing or something. Right. <laugh> <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, it's, it's funny to me, but at the same time there is sort of like this, you know, I don't know, make noise saved my soul kind of aspect to this whole thing because <laugh> it does, you know, it opens the door for a lot of self-realization, but also you get to do it around other people and you get to have fun while you're doing it, which is a pretty big win 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>For sure. If this ever became a church, Scott Yeager would be the Pope 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I think he would be happy to take the role too. I think he would look good with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2434.965" data-end_ts="2435.085" title="2434.965" id=c_"2434.965">__it__</span>. I I believe that he would look good with the hat on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>He'd be correct on that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, he would look good with the hat 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>On that is, that is for sure. That is for sure. And the bi, the Bishop would be Tony 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>I I for sure. Definitely. It's funny like hearing that and like how, one of the things I wanna say about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2453.315" data-end_ts="2453.605" title="2453.315" id=c_"2453.315">__Mara__</span> on the spot is it doesn't have to be a big organized event like we do in la you know, or like the dudes do in Seattle or like Chicago. You know what, Darwin, if you wanna do one next weekend in your backyard, you know what? Invite a few friends over, take the speakers out back and the system's out back and jam out outside and have a good time. Right. You know what, that's the same thing that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2481.765" data-end_ts="2481.925" title="2481.765" id=c_"2481.765">__mod__</span> on the spot. It's whatever you want to be or if you want to go camping and run your system off of your car and listen to your system through your car speakers, cool. That could be it too. It's whatever you want it to be. Just keep it outdoors, keep it, if anybody wants to show up and check it out, keep it open to anyone and just use a modular, that's it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>It's literally like that simple. And one of the things that I think B and i or we're trying to get some camping time coming up and we're just like, you know what, like we like to take these out and just go jam out on our own in the desert. It could be a solo sesh, right? You could take a couple people with you or you could organize 50 people to come out there. It's any and all of it. That's what I wanna remind people about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2532.845" data-end_ts="2533.165" title="2532.845" id=c_"2532.845">__Module__</span> on the spot is it doesn't have to be a big, big organized event. It can be as small as you want it to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that's an important thing to, to do because, or to talk about because it is, it would be tempting now for anybody, for a guy like me to say, oh well, you know, if I would've gotten into it x number of years ago when it was small, it could <span style="color:red" data-ts="2557.965" data-end_ts="2558.125" title="2557.965" id=c_"2557.965">__have__</span>, you know, I could <span style="color:red" data-ts="2558.765" data-end_ts="2558.965" title="2558.765" id=c_"2558.765">__have__</span> had these things, but now it's too big for me. There's there's no such thing for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Sure. And like when, when Ben and I go camping and we jam out outside in the desert somewhere or wherever we're camping or we did this trip up to Oregon coast and it was awesome and it was like, you know what? I had just as much fun doing that just us two as I did last night, like with, and you know, a ton of my friends were there. I'm sure it's great to like have the friends around and stuff, but you know what, it was just as much fun like just us indeed and just exploring and you know what, and making a piece of music on the spot just for me. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, rodent, I appreciate your time. One last question because I just called you Rodent and it reminded me that I wanted to ask you about this. When people go online, they're gonna find, a few ways to hear your music or find out about you. And sometimes you're called rodent and sometimes you're called Rodent 5 1 6 very occasionally, but not very often. You're called Eric. Which are you? Rodent and Rodent 5 1 6 are the same. Why? Why the different names? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Well, rodent's always been my nickname since I was a little kid. Okay. And I actually, this industrial band that I had in the early nineties in Washington DC was called Rodent. It was short-lived and you know, the quality of it was probably pretty horrible <laugh>. But that's been my nickname. It's been my, the name that I put on all my photo work <span style="color:red" data-ts="2664.045" data-end_ts="2664.335" title="2664.045" id=c_"2664.045">__road__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2664.335" data-end_ts="2664.535" title="2664.335" id=c_"2664.335">__at__</span> 5 1 6 is my, is my Instagram handle. And then when I started getting asked to play shows in La Outta Nowhere, like I see the, the flyer for the show and it says Rodent 5 1 6 on it. So I got booked as rodent 5 1 6 a few different times and that is how people started. People started putting that, you know, on flyers and on posts and stuff and Sure. Really wrote <span style="color:red" data-ts="2694.325" data-end_ts="2694.485" title="2694.325" id=c_"2694.325">__it__</span>. 5 1 6 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2695.045" data-end_ts="2695.205" title="2695.045" id=c_"2695.045">__is__</span> my Instagram handle. Like Got it. Like my tapes, my records and stuff all just say rodent on it. It's really just rodent. So, but Got it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sometimes the internet decides to name us on its own. Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Yeah, it can for sure. But to clear up the confusion if there is any. Yeah, it's, it's just ent. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right, cool. Well hey man, thank you so much for taking the time. This has been a great chat and I am so looking forward getting out there sometime to where I can come and check out one of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2729.285" data-end_ts="2729.365" title="2729.285" id=c_"2729.285">__the__</span> shows. Maybe sometime I'll come out and play one if nothing else. Tom Hall's a good friend of mine and he is constantly pestering me to, to do it. So, I gotta find a way to make it out there, and, and be a part of it. But you make the great point. There's nothing stopping me from running an extension cord out to the backyard and getting it on. So I appreciate that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>That impetus as well. Know what, that's the beauty of it. That's the beauty of it is you can do your own. If you got a nice space to do it outside, do that. Yeah. You know, get out the house, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Get outta the house, get outta the, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>From outside. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Get outta your mom's basement and do it right, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>That's the whole motivation kind of really behind the whole thing. That's awesome. But dude, thanks so much for having me on your show. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was great. It's great talking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>I've listened to several different, have you different episodes and it's a, it it's a good show, man. Keep it going. I like it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks. I appreciate it. Well, with that, I'll let you get on with your day. I'll talk to you again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Eric: </b>Okay. Alright, thanks Darwin. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2793.445" data-end_ts="2793.845" title="2793.445" id=c_"2793.445">__Alright__</span>, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I want to thank Rodent for the opportunity to hang out and talk. Eric's a great guy and if you aren't checking out the modular on the spot stuff, whether it's in LA or wherever you happen to live, find out if there's any of the modular spot on the spot stuff going on and check it out. It's, as you can tell, it's something that really inspires people. I want to, just let you know that this week we're likely to bridge the 500,000 direct downloads, level, which because of the multipliers of of consolidators and stuff just means, remarkable. A number of listeners on this podcast, it's all because of you, because of your willingness to listen consistently and to share with your friends. And it's also, I also especially wanna shout out to two groups. First of all, all my friends at Cycling 74 who've done a really great job of letting people know what's going on. And then also my friends at Syn Topia who are really responsible for some pretty big leaps in the listenership here. So I wanna thank all of you, so much for helping out helping this become a successful podcast. And I hope you keep listening. Catch you later. Bye.
