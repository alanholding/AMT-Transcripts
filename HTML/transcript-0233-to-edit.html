<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I get a chance to talk to someone who I've known for quite a while. I first met him, just like at various trade shows and stuff. He was a friend of David Zicarelli. David would introduced me, we'd talk smart a little bit and, move along. But then we, our relationship got a little closer over time, and we, in fact, had went and had a brilliant Brazilian dinner. It was, it was pretty fun. And we talked about everything. But then, once cycling had me coming into San Francisco less often, we kind of fell apart. But now we get a chance to talk and you get, you, the listeners get to listen in. This person's name is Chris Muir People in the music world will know him from a lot of different places. Probably most recently his, his efforts in the area of Ula, modules. But he has a long history in doing musical work of all sorts. So with that, we're gonna say hi to Chris. Hey, man. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris Muir: </b>Good afternoon. Good to talk to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for, taking the time and getting back together. It seems like, in a way it seems like just yesterday we went out for dinner, but that was a long time ago, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b><laugh>. It was quite a while ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So why don't you tell me a little bit about what you're up to right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Well, I'm, these days mostly playing guitar again and doing patches for the Eventide, Orville, H 8,000 world, and hoping to get into the H 9,000 eventually still doing some max stuff because, you know, why wouldn't I <laugh>, you know, generally being a goof off. I've basically retired from anything business related. So, yay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. That sounds like, that sounds like kind of a cool gig. Now, the one thing you didn't mention was, making booklet modules, and for a while there, that was kind of your, at least a fairly big effect on, on that marketplace. You're not doing those anymore, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Basically. No. My deal with this is that I've known Don, or I had known Don for a really long time, since the seventies. You know, when he came out with the, the 200 EI, I had a, a little bit of money in the bank. And so I bought a small 200 e system and there were a bunch of things that I wanted to make for the 200 e system, and I could have made them on, you know, perf <span style="color:red" data-ts="150.445" data-end_ts="150.725" title="150.445" id=c_"150.445">__board__</span> and done a crappy job of them. But I thought the way to do this right, is to sell enough of them that I can get professional circuit boards made and nice screen panels. And, and so I asked myself, how many do I have to make of something? And the answer came back somewhere in the 25 to 50 range would be a good point for cost benefit there. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>So I floated a design in the Berkeley community and I said, if we get, you know, 20, there'll be this price. If we get, you know, 50, there'll be this price. And I got about 30 initial sort of firm orders. This was sort of pre-K Kickstarter. So I sort of did it myself and got into a huge pissing match with PayPal. But that's another story. I had to submit letters to PayPal from various customers saying, yes, we do, this was going to be a <span style="color:red" data-ts="199.845" data-end_ts="200.045" title="199.845" id=c_"199.845">__long__</span> lead time before they would release the funds to me. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Oh, because you couldn't show a shipment right away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Right. And it was, you know, it was essentially, what's now Kickstarter, that world, right. But it was, you know, done in the community and over email and all that. So at any rate, I got my first ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="218.165" data-end_ts="218.365" title="218.165" id=c_"218.165">__drill__</span> module made. Ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="219.885" data-end_ts="220.125" title="219.885" id=c_"219.885">__drill__</span> happened to be a domain that I had had for quite a long time because it's, you know, how I like to characterize my guitar sound <laugh>, <laugh> and <laugh>. So I decided to just do it under the ear drill rubric. You know, I ended up making, over the course of maybe eight or nine years, my, I really should check the dates, but it seems like it was about eight or nine years. I ended up making, you know, a few hundred different <span style="color:red" data-ts="245.125" data-end_ts="245.325" title="245.125" id=c_"245.125">__Brooklyn__</span> modules. In the beginning, my concept was, this is great. I'll design all these cool things that I want, and then I'll, I'll get to play them and I'll get professional, you know, level modules of my own design in my own booklet system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="259.645" data-end_ts="259.885" title="259.645" id=c_"259.645">__Your__</span> rig. Yeah. What I seem to have neglected is that someone was gonna have to solder all these, someone was going to have to ship all these, someone was gonna have to answer all the emails. Someone was gonna have to write a manual. What it ended up being was a, low level assembly job. Right. The kind of which I had in college, right. Or shortly after college. It wasn't this cool design job. <laugh>, I can't complain. The ear drill stuff was, was good for me. And I, I enjoyed it, at least at the beginning when it was like new and exciting. But by the time I was done, you know, there had been some customers from hell, which, you know, you're gonna get in any business, but, right. Yeah. And there were an awful lot of great customers too. Don't, I don't wanna paint them <span style="color:red" data-ts="299.805" data-end_ts="299.965" title="299.805" id=c_"299.805">__all__</span> with a bad brush there. And I don't know, it just each, each time I got an email on my ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="305.805" data-end_ts="306.005" title="305.805" id=c_"305.805">__drill__</span> account, I sort of dreaded opening it. 'cause it's Right. You know, what's this gonna be? What fresh hell is this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>So I ended up just sort of walking away. I, I tried a couple of times to, find a way to fund, basically, if I had deep pockets, I could have said, okay, make me a hundred of these and I'll just put 75 of them on the shelf and probably sell them in the next, you know, few years. Right. But I don't have that kind of capital. So it was, you know, how am I going to do this? I'm going to order 25 of these. I'm going to get the few surface mount parts I have put on professionally, and the rest is all through hole, which I'm gonna do on demand. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Grind it out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Right. Grind it out. And it ended up just not being fun. And it ended up, when I sat down in front of the BU <span style="color:red" data-ts="352.725" data-end_ts="352.885" title="352.725" id=c_"352.725">__club__</span>, which I used to love, it was work, and it wasn't, you know, know a fun, my whole history is ruining hobbies, <laugh>. I, I have ruined a lot of hobbies over my life, <laugh>. And so, I ended up calling the whole ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="368.725" data-end_ts="368.965" title="368.725" id=c_"368.725">__drill__</span> thing my Joby Right. Which was sort of job, sort of hobby. And it ended up being more job than hobby. And so I, I just walked away from it. I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="376.525" data-end_ts="376.765" title="376.525" id=c_"376.525">__mean__</span>, I still entertain service stuff, although that's very few and far between. Right. But new stuff, I'm just letting fall in the Bitbucket. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>This idea of like ruining hobbies, though. I mean, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="387.485" data-end_ts="387.685" title="387.485" id=c_"387.485">__is__</span>, there is a, a class of us that, that own that. Right? I mean, so I did this little module called the Art <span style="color:red" data-ts="393.805" data-end_ts="394.045" title="393.805" id=c_"393.805">__Core__</span>, and I, the only, the only variation of it I did is I did the five U ones, dance Nazel in New York, did the ones for, Eurorack. But I remember that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="405.445" data-end_ts="405.685" title="405.445" id=c_"405.445">__love__</span> that. I love that little module. It was so much fun. The first four or five people that bought it, I was so excited to put it together and send it off. And then all of a sudden I found myself just like hating when an order would come in. Right now, you know, that should be an opportunity for joy. You're gonna have a new customer. You get a little money, you get to <span style="color:red" data-ts="424.745" data-end_ts="424.965" title="424.745" id=c_"424.745">__in__</span> interact with a new person in this community that sounds like unmitigated fun. Right. Except what it meant was I was gonna be smelling, solder smoke for a couple of hours, which got feeling kind of grueling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah, yeah. No question about it. And, you know, it's, it's just not fun, that aspect of it. It's not fun doing the ordering parts, you know, the first time you have to redesign a circuit because some part isn't made anymore. Oh, right. It's just, it's, it seems like a, you know, Sisyphus <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="456.615" data-end_ts="456.965" title="456.615" id=c_"456.615">__going__</span> to rock up the hill, and, I soured on the whole making things, and I've, I sort of, my booklet right now is in a very sorry state, but I'm, I'm getting sort of interested again, I've, I've been away from ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="469.725" data-end_ts="469.925" title="469.725" id=c_"469.725">__drill__</span> for almost five years now. And so <laugh>, I'm getting interested in playing the <span style="color:red" data-ts="473.355" data-end_ts="473.645" title="473.355" id=c_"473.355">__Bula__</span> again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, I, I have to imagine, imagine that some of those, some of those scars kind of run deep. This idea of like, sitting down in front of this thing you love and all of a sudden it start looking like work. I think it's, it's fascinating to me because you're actually now telling me that there's potentially a path back from that. Because sometimes, you know, there are things that I do for work that used to be my instruments or my, my technique or my, like secret sauce, and I can't, I can't look at him other, anything other than a different version of punching the clock <span style="color:red" data-ts="508.625" data-end_ts="508.845" title="508.625" id=c_"508.625">__now__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Right, right. And, and I've definitely been there a few times. I mean, my first example of this was when I worked for Zeta Music Systems. We did. Okay. I started out as a guitarist and wanted to make stuff because I was, you know, a poor guitarist. What do you do? You wanna make stuff? So I was working for Zeta Music Systems doing this fancy guitar to MIDI interface in the eighties sometime. And so my job was to play things that made the guitar to MIDI interface, mess up <laugh>, and try and figure out what it did wrong, how it misinterpreted what I played. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="544.945" data-end_ts="545.165" title="544.945" id=c_"544.945">__And__</span>, and so basically I ruined playing guitar for myself for, for doing this for really quite a long time. And eventually that came back. So I have hopes that the <span style="color:red" data-ts="554.285" data-end_ts="554.685" title="554.285" id=c_"554.285">__buchla__</span> love and modular love in general will come back. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. I'm just realizing how from, from that kind of like starting point in the industry to like owning a site called Ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="565.925" data-end_ts="566.165" title="565.925" id=c_"565.925">__Drill__</span>, I mean, all comes together <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, interesting you brought that up. What I'd like to do is kind of explore your background and how you got where you are. I mean, you've had an amazing this, I know you've had <span style="color:red" data-ts="580.165" data-end_ts="580.285" title="580.165" id=c_"580.165">__a__</span> really kind of an amazing career getting work with a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="583.125" data-end_ts="583.405" title="583.125" id=c_"583.125">__comp__</span> interesting companies. Why don't you take us through the process of like, growing up and what your interests were and how you moved them into the, into the music instrument world? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>I have a friend from high school, pat Dunin, who we just got back in touch recently in the last five or 10 years. And he took a look at what I was doing now, and he says, you know, your interests have been remarkably consistent <laugh>. And I think that's right. I think I, you know, I've been fascinated by sound from an early age. I have been a guitarist since, you know, early teens. I, had the good fortune to live two doors down from Leo's music in Oakland. And I became good friends with Bill Stevens, who was a, sales guy there and manage the <span style="color:red" data-ts="628.305" data-end_ts="628.725" title="628.305" id=c_"628.305">__nation__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="629.295" data-end_ts="629.645" title="629.295" id=c_"629.295">__since__</span> department there. Okay. And so I would go in and play with this stuff and, you know, I, I was sort of an auto didact on this as I taught myself, stuff on the 2,600, which was brand, you know, relatively new then. And I convinced Bill to buy stuff, which was great because, you know, I got to play with it. I didn't have to buy it. You didn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have to pay for it, really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Leo's music had it in stock. And, he knew that he could call on me to explain it to someone who came in asking questions. So I sort of, you know, would set up for an hour or two, a day in Leo's music in Oakland and, you know, hang out and play stuff. And that was great. But I couldn't afford any of this stuff. So then I ended up going to Cabrio College in Santa Cruz where I could study on the ula. And, you know, that was, that was really great because <span style="color:red" data-ts="678.125" data-end_ts="678.245" title="678.125" id=c_"678.125">__I__</span>, you know, I, I really didn't realize how great I had it at Cabrillo. I mean, the Cabrillo Contemporary Music Festival is remarkable. And, you know, it's got people like John Cage and Lou Harrison and Alan Strange, and, you know, Dennis Russell Davies as a conductor. And it was like a world class thing in this junior college in <span style="color:red" data-ts="697.225" data-end_ts="697.445" title="697.225" id=c_"697.225">__Jan__</span> Cruz. And in the electronic music department there was Bob Beatie who, taught stuff on the ula. And I couldn't afford the ula, so I built myself a surge, which at the time was <span style="color:red" data-ts="708.845" data-end_ts="709.005" title="708.845" id=c_"708.845">__the__</span> poor man's Ula. Although it's certainly not that anymore. Not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Right. And, you know, I, I met a lot of people there. I met Don <span style="color:red" data-ts="715.445" data-end_ts="715.845" title="715.445" id=c_"715.445">__Buchla__</span> during that period through Bob Beatty, who was the teacher at Cabrillo. And then while I was in school, I got this offer to come be a solder monkey for the first time at, salamander or SMS in San Francisco, which was a truly niche, synthesizer company. We made, you know, a handful of big systems, but truly a handful. And we did this one, our one attempted a commercial product was this thing called The Voice 400, which was cool for its day. But, it was, it was a monophonic, analog synth Right. About the time the <span style="color:red" data-ts="746.765" data-end_ts="746.965" title="746.765" id=c_"746.765">__Profit__</span> five came out and the DX seven came out. Right. So the fact it was, you know, a programmable modular synth with a analog delay line in it that was also programmable, which was pretty unusual for its day. What 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was the name of this thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>It's the Voice 400 from SMS. It's in a couple of, you know, synth history books. And it's a, a funny looking little lunchbox, breadbox sort of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>'cause I'll tell you, man, I feel like it's like a point of pride to never get surprised about a piece. I fricking never heard of this. Interesting. Okay. Sorry about that a little. That's okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="780.965" data-end_ts="781.085" title="780.965" id=c_"780.965">__A__</span> little diversion. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And right about this time, you know, Dave Smith had, while I was at Salamander, Dave Smith sent around his infamous pre <span style="color:red" data-ts="790.435" data-end_ts="790.725" title="790.435" id=c_"790.435">__midi__</span> questionnaire, like, you know, would you be interested in a, an interface between synthesizers? And that was before any of the, the first MIDI meetings. That was sort of the dawn of midi. And, I could see that writing on the wall. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Who did he send this to? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>He sent it to anyone who I think had ever advertised, <span style="color:red" data-ts="808.605" data-end_ts="808.725" title="808.605" id=c_"808.605">__had__</span> address <laugh> in Yeah. Every time he, you know, he got to us because we were sort of local. And I had met him a couple times, and I, in fact, owned a, he had this programmer thing, which was a couple of a DSRs, and some knobs, which you could say presets on, which I used with the Surge for a while. Okay. So I, you know, met him a couple times and he knew loosely of, salamander and, SMS. At any rate, I could see the writing on the wall with, with midi. So I, when the opportunity came to go to Zeta and work on a cutting edge at the time guitar interface, I jumped at it. And, you know, during all this is basically, this period was when I met the op code guys and David Z and, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="854.445" data-end_ts="854.565" title="854.445" id=c_"854.445">__I__</span>, I got to know David relatively well when em and Jam Factory came out from intelligent music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Right. And crucially, at this period, I met David Wessel from Sin <span style="color:red" data-ts="863.885" data-end_ts="864.085" title="863.885" id=c_"863.885">__Matt__</span> in Berkeley, <span style="color:red" data-ts="864.525" data-end_ts="864.725" title="864.525" id=c_"864.525">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="864.725" data-end_ts="864.885" title="864.725" id=c_"864.725">__late__</span> Yeah. Great. David Wessel, who turned me on to Ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="868.105" data-end_ts="868.325" title="868.105" id=c_"868.105">__Cam__</span> Max, who I think it might've still been called Patcher at that time. And you know, that that started a whole love affair with Max. I don't know. You know, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="876.725" data-end_ts="876.845" title="876.725" id=c_"876.725">__are__</span> a few other things in there. You know, there's, I had a, a very short lived band with Dom <span style="color:red" data-ts="881.885" data-end_ts="882.205" title="881.885" id=c_"881.885">__Buchla__</span>, David Wessel, Keith McMillan, and I called the Thunder Quartet playing Dom Buchla's Thunders, and Oh, yeah. I wrote, I think probably the first third party Max externals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yep. Still kicking, <span style="color:red" data-ts="894.915" data-end_ts="895.205" title="894.915" id=c_"894.915">__yeah__</span>, still kicking, like, like Mul was Multis Slider. One of 'em 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Maybe No, multis Slider wasn't one of them, but, somebody else. Right. You know, counter and Uzi and Bucket and the Gwi G <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.565" data-end_ts="905.765" title="905.565" id=c_"905.565">__Gate__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're responsible for Uzi. Oh my goodness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Borax and, you know, mouse State decode, I can't remember some of 'em, they're, there are a bunch of 'em. Histo Key slider, you know, just <span style="color:red" data-ts="916.845" data-end_ts="916.965" title="916.845" id=c_"916.845">__a__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, key slider. <span style="color:red" data-ts="918.485" data-end_ts="918.605" title="918.485" id=c_"918.485">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="918.605" data-end_ts="918.645" title="918.605" id=c_"918.605">__was__</span>, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And then I smartened up a little bit and realized that if I got a job in an area that wasn't music related, I wouldn't ruin any hobbies. Right. <laugh>. So I got a job with electronics for imaging, which does, at the time it was trying to be a software company. It ended up being more of a hardware company because a product just took off like crazy, which is this, this device which connects to a variety of copiers, color copiers, and turns them in, turns them into a printer, which was, you know, odd in the early nineties. And it allowed you to have high quality color prints from a copier, which you may already have already have. Right. You know, if you're a business, it was a big expensive piece. But at any rate, <span style="color:red" data-ts="960.925" data-end_ts="961.125" title="960.925" id=c_"960.925">__at__</span> DFI, you know, I found out that the music industry salaries are really terrible. <laugh>, if you get a job in the real world, they'll pay you pretty well, and Yeah. Right, right. <laugh>, sorry. And so I worked there for about 10 years or so, and I was still doing music stuff, and I managed to get, I managed to regrow some love of, like playing guitar, for example, during this period, shortly after this, I did the Yo Miles project with Henry Kaiser and <span style="color:red" data-ts="987.285" data-end_ts="987.445" title="987.285" id=c_"987.285">__Ada__</span>, Leo Smith, and a bunch of other great players. And we did a, a few, CDs covering the least <span style="color:red" data-ts="994.085" data-end_ts="994.405" title="994.085" id=c_"994.085">__liked__</span> period of Miles Davis history. So <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>How can you go wrong with that? The, the electric period? Let's see. Then I made the mistake of two bad jobs in a row, one Gibson, where, I joined Rejoined Keith McMillan, who was at that point running the Gibson Western Innovation zone. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, you know, some good work came out of there, but Gibson is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1018.965" data-end_ts="1019.085" title="1018.965" id=c_"1018.965">__a__</span>, well, anyone in the industry knows Gibson is a weird ass company to work for. Yeah. And, you know, we were working on stuff which couldn't be made out of wood, so it was particularly hopeless there. <laugh>, you know, if you can, if you can make it outta wood, Gibson has a, a half a chance of understanding it, but therefore, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1038.665" data-end_ts="1038.885" title="1038.665" id=c_"1038.665">__as__</span> into tech, have been <span style="color:red" data-ts="1040.755" data-end_ts="1041.045" title="1040.755" id=c_"1040.755">__hill__</span> starred. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Now, I, I'm trying to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1044.485" data-end_ts="1044.605" title="1044.485" id=c_"1044.485">__get__</span>, I'm trying to like, wrap my head around the timing of this. Where, where did Zeta fit in on this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Zeta was pretty early for me. Oh, okay. It was probably, early, maybe mid 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Eighties. I see. Okay. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Probably mid eighties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then you went to work at Gibson when, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Late I, I left EFI after, after, you know, a decade or so at a real company and a real startup that went public. So there was, you know, a little bit of, upside to that. Sure. I then went back to Gibson working with Keith, who I'd enjoyed working with at Zeta at Zeta. Right. And I decided I was not going to be a manager anymore. I was going to be an individual contributor, which sounded way more fun. Yeah. So, so I go to Gibson and I last, you know, a couple of months, maybe, maybe three months before Henry Sitz of Gibson and Keith have a huge falling out, and Keith gets, gets summarily summoned to Nashville and fired while he's in Nashville. And so suddenly, gee, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1105.645" data-end_ts="1105.965" title="1105.645" id=c_"1105.645">__whizz__</span>, the Gibson Western innovation zone has no head anymore <laugh>. So I didn't want this, I tried to not do this, but they ended up, making me in charge of it for a little while. Oh, no. So go the dreams of being an independent <laugh>, contributor again, <laugh>. And it was like a, a political nightmare. You know, I met some really great people there who I'm still friends with, but, boy, it was, Gibson is one of the most dysfunctional companies ever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's interesting because I've known a lot of people that have had some interaction with them, and that's exactly the feedback you get, which is, I met some amazing people. Oh my God, are they screwed up? <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>You know, they basically have a club. You, you say, I'm in the, I'm in the Silver Club, I'm in the Gold Club, I'm in the Platinum Club, and that's indicating how many times you've been fired and rehired at Gibson. Honest to God, I'm not kidding. This is, this is truly the case. It was sort of a nightmare, but, you know, some good work came out of it. The Equinex Digital Pro came out of that, you know, starting with the seed from Mattias Grove. But, you know, a, a lot of great work started there. The Zippy thing, which ended up being, the seeds of OSC, started between there and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1183.415" data-end_ts="1183.765" title="1183.415" id=c_"1183.415">__Sinat__</span>. So, you know, there was, there were smart people there. We had fantastic lunches. What can I say? You know, we'd go out to lunch with a bunch of smart guys and that, that's the only thing I miss out of working is lunching with smart guys. Right. But it totally fell apart. At one point the doors were padlocked and all the hard drives were removed from the machines, and geez, half the people there were sued and it, it got really ugly at, at Gibson. And so from there, I, I don't know if this is, which one is the frying pad and which one is the fire. From there, I went to Headspace slash Beatnik run by Thomas Dolby, and I made it about eight years there, which amazes me today. That's the, that's one of the weirder jobs ever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In what way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Well, it was run by a pop star. And you know, Thomas is a really smart guy. I, I don't mean to detract from him being smart, but he is not even sort of a businessman. And he was trying to sell products that he had a name for and a loose concept for, but nothing else. And he was, you know, talking to tech companies about, you know, acquiring this great thing I have. And one thing that's great out of the whole, Headspace beatnik thing is that we came out with this soft synth that was a very lightweight, soft synth, which found its way into a lot of cell phones, a bunch of manufacturers, actually, I don't. And so I got to spend some time in Finland and Japan and Sweden and Germany, and talking to all these manufacturers who were licensing the, the Headspace engine. But this was like right around the time of the.com boom. And venture capital people were throwing money at us to build giant, scalable systems about something didn't matter what really. But, you know, they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1287.125" data-end_ts="1287.325" title="1287.125" id=c_"1287.125">__want__</span>, they wanted to see us, you know, build something big and here's some money. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, like, how much of that do you think was driven by, I mean, one of the things Dolby was, was in addition to being a great songwriter and great performer, he was also a great promoter. Right. That's one of the things I would say is whether it was like, whether he was talking about digital audio in the general case, or talking about something specific that he was doing with that team, he knew how to excite people with words. Right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>That's absolutely correct. And he could get a meeting just about anywhere. Oh sure. Of course. Mostly 'cause these, you know, tech people had, been making out with their girlfriend in, in college blinded 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1330.365" data-end_ts="1330.485" title="1330.365" id=c_"1330.365">__You__</span> with Science 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b><laugh>, right? Yeah. One of my favorite Thomas Quips is we were at Adobe meeting with someone and someone in the parking lot said, wow, Thomas Doby great. You know, you only had one hit, didn't you? And he looks at him without looking at eye and says, it's one more than you had, isn't it? And, you know, he has a, a rabid fan base, but if you're in the tech biz, it's better if you have someone who has a, a good grasp of tech. He had a, a grasp of what he wanted to use tech for, but not how tech was created. Yeah. And we were essentially trying to create tech for third parties. Right. And then they got into this whole needle drop licensing model, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1371.225" data-end_ts="1371.575" title="1371.225" id=c_"1371.225">__which__</span>, you know, never really panned out, but they sunk millions of dollars in. So yeah, Headspace was, it was interesting. Thomas recently wrote a book where he threw me under the bus, so I'm apparently the reason he didn't found YouTube <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You bastard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>I know, I know. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1390.575" data-end_ts="1390.775" title="1390.575" id=c_"1390.575">__it__</span>, after it came out, a lot of the Headspace people said, I can't believe he did that. And, you know, are you gonna write a rebuttal? And I realized, well, no, I'm not gonna write a rebuttal. There is zero upside for me trying to write a rebuttal to this book. And, you know, the funny thing is, is that we talked a few times while he was writing this book, and he sent me an early copy to get my feedback on it, and I can't imagine what he thought my feedback was going to be. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1416.325" data-end_ts="1416.815" title="1416.325" id=c_"1416.325">__Alright__</span>. There are other people in there whose name he changed in the book. Oh, really? But I, you know, water under the bridge now. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess. So then af after that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1427.285" data-end_ts="1427.605" title="1427.285" id=c_"1427.285">__where__</span>, what was your arc 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Pretty shortly after that? I did the ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="1430.565" data-end_ts="1430.765" title="1430.565" id=c_"1430.565">__drill__</span> thing. You know, I, I had been playing the Buchla. I had been trying to, proselytize the Buchla on various websites like, you know, Myler and a handful of others. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because there were very few examples at that point. Right. And, you know, the, the examples that you tend to fall into with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1447.755" data-end_ts="1448.045" title="1447.755" id=c_"1447.755">__Bula__</span> are not deemed quote musical unquote. Right. From a lot of people's point of view. So I tried to, and, you know, the people who are gonna buy the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.795" data-end_ts="1458.085" title="1457.795" id=c_"1457.795">__Bula__</span> are going to wanna do odd music. There's no question about it. That's, you know, people who resonate with that are people who resonate with weird stuff. But I tried to do, in addition to, my more normal sort of odd stuff, I tried to do a few musical examples or examples that other people would consider musical. And I had a lot of fun doing that. And so then I decided, well, you know, I should just make some modules for this. And Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1480.405" data-end_ts="1480.605" title="1480.405" id=c_"1480.405">__And__</span> off you were 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And off I were went. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now it's, it's interesting. I, so for people out there who are, who are curious about this, one of the things I love, there's, you had a site long ago, it was x <span style="color:red" data-ts="1493.685" data-end_ts="1494.445" title="1493.685" id=c_"1493.685">__fade.com__</span>, literally X-F-A-D-E, and we're gonna talk about these, these website naming things in a minute. But it actually has a bunch of both, pictures and sound examples of your work from the time, which I think will be interesting because they still actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="1510.405" data-end_ts="1510.645" title="1510.405" id=c_"1510.405">__real__</span>, really hold up nicely. Because for myself, this was one of the, one of the cases where I was just like, really happy to hear what you did, because instead of it sounding like ULA in default mode, what it sounded like was someone's voice coming out of a ula. And I think people weren't sure how that happened, you know? And I think that you kind of pointed 'em to a way that says, here's what, here's what it can sound like. At least, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. And I, I think people don't realize that it's a general purpose box. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1542.385" data-end_ts="1542.605" title="1542.385" id=c_"1542.385">__You__</span>, you know, people think it's only good for this specific, you know, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1546.885" data-end_ts="1547.165" title="1546.885" id=c_"1546.885">__Krell__</span> patch, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1547.935" data-end_ts="1548.285" title="1547.935" id=c_"1547.935">__right__</span>? Yeah. <laugh>, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1548.885" data-end_ts="1549.085" title="1548.885" id=c_"1548.885">__Kre__</span> patch is a great example where, you know, you're, you're modulating the frequency of random events and it's doing this little lippy thing. And that's great. Don't get me wrong. I've done hours of that <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>As have we all 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b><laugh>. Yes. But the key is that you can do all sorts of stuff with it, and once you meet it halfway, it's a great user interface for making a lot of racket pretty quick. And most of the stuff I did was realtime improv, which is sort of, you know, what I like to do in general, Uhhuh <affirmative> and it, the Buchla allows you to be in control of a large <span style="color:red" data-ts="1584.325" data-end_ts="1584.685" title="1584.325" id=c_"1584.325">__pallet__</span> of sounds in a fairly atomic way. I was generally not using any of the buchla sequencers with it. I was using this Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1592.445" data-end_ts="1592.765" title="1592.445" id=c_"1592.445">__Patch__</span> I came up with called, gyre, which is a, a fairly giant max patch actually, which doesn't run in either max seven or max eight. Oh, no. So, you know, there'll be a lot of work to, to move that forward if I do decide to move that forward. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>So yeah, the, the whole ULA thing was great. And, I guess I got one of the earlier 200 e examples and I was already sort of active on a couple of these sites, and so I found myself put in the position of defending it. It's not good for tonal music. Well, it can be good for tonal music. Look, here's an example. The timing is terrible on her, you know, whatever the, the meme UR was. Right. And, so I did a bunch of examples that tried to show different aspects of what you could do with the device. And, you know, luckily there are people who came along after me who picked up this baton. Right. You know, Todd Barton's a great example. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1649.775" data-end_ts="1650.125" title="1649.775" id=c_"1649.775">__Right__</span>. There are a handful of other great examples of people who had taken this, the reins Yeah. Yeah. Take up the reins of, of this. And it's a, it's an interesting, Don you know, was a fascinating individual. I I knew him for a really long time. I worked for him briefly a couple of times. Then I realized, you know, I'm much better off having him as a friend than as an employer <laugh>. Right, right. And, you know, I knew him right up to the end. And, fascinating, fascinating individual for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>People think he's like a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.195" data-end_ts="1683.485" title="1683.195" id=c_"1683.195">__that__</span> they think he's like, mean and fierce and, and prickly and, you know, there were some aspects of that, but he was actually really funny in a weird sort of lowkey way. Yeah. And it took people, you know, hanging out with them a little bit before they realized that, you know, he didn't eat children for breakfast. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but also that he had, I mean, what you might take as sort of like a, a mean or anchor response is just him being kind of like cynically humorous. Right. He had that cynical humor thing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Politically humorous. And, you know, he wasn't one for small talk. And he, he really wasn't one for, self-promotion or, or, you know, hero worship at all. At one of his last, performances, last time I saw him perform live was with his wife Janique at, at the SF Jazz Place. And there was a panel discussion afterwards. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so there were a bunch of people, someone asked Don a question that went on for, you know, 45 seconds setting up this question. And I could tell right at the beginning of this question, I know how he's going to answer it. So it's this long elaborate question. And then Don pauses for a beat, leans into the microphone and says, no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>You know, and that was Don. It was, and people who knew him in the audience <span style="color:red" data-ts="1760.825" data-end_ts="1761.045" title="1760.825" id=c_"1760.825">__saw__</span> went t he t he <laugh>. And everybody else was going, what's wrong with this guy? You know what <laugh> So yeah. Don the, the mystery of Don, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you've got, you've had a chance to really get to know some amazing people. In addition to Don, you brought up the name of David <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.125" data-end_ts="1776.605" title="1776.125" id=c_"1776.125">__Westell__</span>, who, if there's a, if there's like a through thread of people that were amazingly influential to the West Coast, sort of like music maker and music developer community, it's him, he helped so many people, but also helped promote so many people and helped push the technology. He seems like an amazing guy. I, I got to meet him a few times, but I never really got to know him at all. And I, and I feel like that's one of those two sad things of my life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>It, it is. I wish everyone could have gotten to know David because he was a man of enthusiasms. Yes. When he likes something, he really, something. And he, he tried to get other people to see the beauty in it that he saw, you know, max was a great example early on, you know, he was at Aircom when Max was developed. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1828.245" data-end_ts="1828.465" title="1828.245" id=c_"1828.245">__He__</span>, his enthusiasm for things was contagious. Mm-Hmm. A lot of students I'm sure use Max to this day because of him. 'cause his, his love of it was, was there and his love of, of strange surfaces, you know, sort of influenced Donna on Thunder. And, he went on definitely 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Keith McMillan, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Definitely Keith McMillan, you know, we were all hanging in Berkeley at about the same time. And, you know, we all managed to resonate with similar, similar goals there. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So it's interesting though that he, he was so influential and, and I would say he was even sort of like the fountain from which a lot of instruments and software and stuff flowed, but he never, he never chose to do anything like that himself, that I know of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Actually, he did, cinema has this thing called slabs, which was a, a project of his, which was sensing, surfaces at audio rates as opposed to a slower control rate. Okay. Alright. So it was, it was sampled ungodly fast, and the audio signal flowed over into the computer where there were drivers and, and matched things that dealt with this control surface at audio rate, which is great from a subtle gesture and sort of intimacy point of view. Right. You know, little sliding on pads were picked up, whereas if you're trying to turn that into events, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1910.045" data-end_ts="1910.265" title="1910.045" id=c_"1910.045">__it__</span> didn't quite work as well. So, you know, he, he could control VCAs, you know, the moral equivalent of VCAs, in max from this pad and not have it feel like you were controlling it over midi. Right. You know, because you were controlling it directly with audio. And so he did a bunch of stuff like that. There's a recording that he and, Henry Kaiser and I did that's called at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1933.245" data-end_ts="1933.465" title="1933.245" id=c_"1933.245">__Sin__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1933.525" data-end_ts="1933.745" title="1933.525" id=c_"1933.525">__Mat__</span>. And, he's playing the slab there. I'm playing the Ula Henry's playing guitar, and he, he does some remarkable work there. He's, you know, he's had a few pieces over the years he's done, and he's done quite a few performances with various people. But you're right in that he was more influential in his personal output might imply. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Well, I think that that was the result of his enthusiasm. I mean, one of the things I can say is the times I did met him meet him often it was like at, you know, when EES had the, had the show in, in San Francisco at the Moscone Center, I, I'd like always run into him there. And he always would have like some new technology that was, you know, he'd did that thing where he was almost like hopping in place. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1978.365" data-end_ts="1978.565" title="1978.365" id=c_"1978.365">__Right__</span>. He was so excited. Right. I always looked forward to him coming because if nothing else I knew that like, no matter what kind of science fiction project I would have in my head, he'd show up with something that was like bizarrely further than that. You know, Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b><affirmative>, Uhhuh <affirmative>. Yeah. No, I think that's right. And I think he, he, because he was tapped into the, the research of, well of institutions around the world, but particularly uc, Berkeley, where <span style="color:red" data-ts="2003.375" data-end_ts="2003.725" title="2003.375" id=c_"2003.375">__Sinat__</span> was based, he knew about a lot of stuff about processing, that, you know, still hasn't quite seen the light of day. You know, he was involved in doing projects with very large instruction words and a few other experimental techniques that, the computing department at uc, Berkeley was coming up with. But, you know, still hadn't quite seen the, the light of day and, you know, at, at Erko, basically he was the, I would say that certainly Miller Puckett wrote it, and there was some desire there in general, but if David Wessell hadn't been at Aircom, there would be no Max or MSB <span style="color:red" data-ts="2039.465" data-end_ts="2039.685" title="2039.465" id=c_"2039.465">__Oh__</span>, you know, he, he was the, the protector of Max there. 'cause you know, when when Miller started Max, there, MIDI was seen as a, a common technology <laugh>, you know, we're aircom we, we don't deal with common technologies. And so it took some protecting at Aircom to let Max Flower there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Unfortunately. So, so really interesting. Let's, let's get back a little bit more to your work. First of all, you said that you're kind of getting back into guitar playing and there the guitar kind of like weaves throughout this whole story. Right. What kind, are you still doing ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="2081.055" data-end_ts="2081.335" title="2081.055" id=c_"2081.055">__drill__</span> music or have you find a way to like new age out the whole thing?

<b>Chris: </b>Well, I'm doing a lot of stuff with looping and, and writing strange little loopers for the, the Eventide world. You know, some for the Max World, but I, I like to be able to take, you know, take a rack someplace and play and not have to deal with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2100.055" data-end_ts="2100.175" title="2100.055" id=c_"2100.055">__a__</span> computer. So I've got a bunch of stuff on SoundCloud. soundcloud.com/cbm will get you there. Okay. You know, it's, it's not what a lot of people would call music. Some of it is, you know, fairly pleasant. Some of it is annoying. I've got a, long-term project going with a few friends from Santa Cruz called, the Lunar Asylum, and we do a bunch of, annoying racket. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It seems like, like Santa Cruz is like the center of wacky Looper people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Rick, Rick Walker and his brother Bill. Yeah. Are both there and they do the Loop Fest, which Right. Actually, the Lunar asylum is playing the Loop Fest this year. Oh, nice. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2140.205" data-end_ts="2140.405" title="2140.205" id=c_"2140.205">__Sometime__</span>, sometime in October. I don't know the exact date. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2142.605" data-end_ts="2142.805" title="2142.605" id=c_"2142.605">__Okay__</span>. And the whole deal with my music is that it's sort of my, it's my centering practice more than anything else. Yeah. You know, I don't do it to make a product usually, you know, there have been some product stuff that has come out, but I rely on, some of my co-conspirators to, be the driving force behind that because I tend to, do it and then wanna move on. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually a really interesting way to put it, you know? 'cause I've often wondered, like for me, I have never had this burning desire to release, you know, to do releases. Right, right. But I can't wait for the next opportunity to perform. Right. And why is that? It's, it's what, what you just said really resonates with me. This, this thing that, where it's like making this stuff, first of all, it always feels like it's an expression of how I feel now. I'm not gonna feel that way the next time I do this damn thing. So it may not resonate then, but it seemed to resonate at the moment, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Right. And so what I've been trying to do, both with my booklet work and with the recent guitar work, is come up with systems that allow me to create a large, more or less organized racket Right. In real time. Right. Interesting. And, you know, don't wanna go back and, you know, okay, there's a clam in this particular guitar piece I'm playing. That's what lives there, you know? Right. Clam lives there. Yeah. Put, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Put put the razor blade down. We're not gonna be editing today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Right. And, you know, I, I taken it, an adage from miles to heart, which is, there's no wrong note. There's only a wrong next note, <laugh>. And the beauty of that is it's absolutely true. If you play a wrong note and then figure out a way to make that work, it's a beautiful thing. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A lot of times better than anything that would be fitting within the, within dispen posts. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. I mean, my, my take on Berkeley train musicians is that they're largely great, but they, they've had all their mistakes, you know, slapped out of them. Right. So they have to rely on their imagination, which isn't often enough. <laugh>. So because they're not making mistakes, they don't have to recover from those mistakes. Right. And you know, I think they're poorer for it largely. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, hey <span style="color:red" data-ts="2283.825" data-end_ts="2284.025" title="2283.825" id=c_"2283.825">__man__</span>, <laugh>, I'll spending time with you. It's always, it's always great. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Is good. I've, missed it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, me too. So our time already got burned up, but before I let you go, I have to ask something. I've always been curious, I've never asked you about this before. I'm curious about the answer. Okay. So first of all, your email is a thing@well.com. Like the first, you know, one of the first widely used talk places on the internet, you hold, such web domains as ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="2320.325" data-end_ts="2320.565" title="2320.325" id=c_"2320.325">__drill__</span> and X fade. CBM is, you know, you must, you, you would've been <laugh>. How early did you have to be to get A-A-T-L-A, you know, three letter acronym on, on SoundCloud? You seem to be on the front end of every damn thing. Do you just like shotgun stuff and whenever a new thing comes up, grab it? Or how does that work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>I guess I inherited from David Enthusiasms. David Wes Enthusiasms. <laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. So basically the whole x the whole X <span style="color:red" data-ts="2349.445" data-end_ts="2349.645" title="2349.445" id=c_"2349.445">__phase__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2349.645" data-end_ts="2349.765" title="2349.645" id=c_"2349.645">__and__</span> ear drill thing came up early on in the days of the web. I think this was either, I bet this was beatnik, but it could have been a little earlier where what's still available. Right. And X <span style="color:red" data-ts="2362.285" data-end_ts="2362.565" title="2362.285" id=c_"2362.285">__fade__</span> and ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="2362.885" data-end_ts="2363.085" title="2362.885" id=c_"2362.885">__drill__</span> were both available. Unfortunately, cave painting was gone, <laugh>, and fuzz tone was gone. <laugh>, a lot of, you know, basic. So I, I think I did both X fade and ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="2375.565" data-end_ts="2375.805" title="2375.565" id=c_"2375.565">__drill__</span> one afternoon thinking what's still around? That's short. Yeah, right. And there's some DJ magazine which really, really wanted X fade and it was gonna <span style="color:red" data-ts="2385.045" data-end_ts="2385.125" title="2385.045" id=c_"2385.045">__gimme__</span> a couple of K for it, but, you know, I figured, yeah, I've got it. Why not sit with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fun. Chris, this was such a fun time as always. It was great. Thanks a lot for taking time outta your schedule. Get back out there and start, drilling some ears with the guitar and we're gonna talk again soon. All right.
