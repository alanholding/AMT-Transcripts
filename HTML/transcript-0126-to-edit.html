<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the pleasure of talking to a guy who I consider a longtime friend. We got, we met each other at a max workshop some years ago, and, have kind of stayed in loose contact over the years. We've gotten a chance to bump into each other, in many different places in many different ways. His name's Steven James Taylor, and he is a person with a very fascinating career and a fascinating set of interests. So, rather than me trying to explain it, what we're gonna do is, first of all, say hi to Steven. Hi, Steven. How are you? Hi, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen James Taylor: </b>Darwin How you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Doing? I'm great. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna have you tell us about how you identify yourself. Tell us a little bit about how you think of yourself and what some of the work is that you've been doing lately. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Okay. My training is as a composer. I have a music degree from Stanford. And in the seventies and eighties, that's what I was doing, like concert music and, and film music. But I guess more in the last five years or so, I've kind of rebranded myself as a music oriented content creator. Because of the evolution of technology, it's, it's come such a long way from when I started that it seems nowadays more than norm, that any creative person has their hand in different media. It's one of the reasons I was drawn to Max in that it's sort of, platform agnostic. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And, I don't know of really any other program that has that kind of scope. But I think it's also endemic of our times where, you know, just about anyone you meet who's creative knows a little bit about Photoshop, a little bit about video editing, a little bit about putting, making beats a little bit about, writing, you know, and, and, so coming out of the music background, I've sort of applied my skillset, as much as I can to some of these, other areas like filmmaking and graphics and, and, sound design. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's actually really interesting. But it's also very kind of a modern approach to being a media artist, right? Is that you have, you do have to be willing to take on a lot of things, and as long as you have kind of your own voice, you know, generally developed in one of the disciplines, as long as you have your own voice, you can a lot of times, bring that voice to other kinds of media as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah, I, I'm, I I, I think it would be harder to come into all of them at the same time. It's a question I always pose to people, you know, based on that, that, idea of Malcolm Gladwell's that, you know, it takes 10,000 hours to master something. Right. But if you draw the analogy to $10,000 in the bank, does it matter if you have $2,000 in five different banks, it's still 10 grand. Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Good point. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="197.845" data-end_ts="197.925" title="197.845" id=c_"197.845">__if__</span> you're 2000 hours as a cello player, 2000 hours as a dancer, 2000 hours as a script writer, you know, would it all amount to, to mastery? I, that's debatable. Right. But I would assume it would, if your art form involve cello writing, you know, sound design, you know, if all those things were sort of your performance art, then yeah. That might be 10,000 hours. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I, I also think that there's something to be said for, if you're skilled in one area of the media arts, then, you can learn a lot by just diving into one of the others into something else. So if you are an experienced, if you're an experienced musician, jumping into filmmaking is a real valuable exercise. You know, the first time you do it, you're probably not gonna be good at it, but yeah. What you will do is you will have, you know, a lot of the things you learned as a musician, pacing, timing, the narrative curve and all that stuff. It's got, it's got its equivalents in film, film editing and stuff like that. So there's ways to take some of those concepts and really reuse 'em in a different context. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. Certainly with those two, you know, the, the generically you're carving a block of time. Right. So it doesn't matter if you're carving it with visuals or carving it with audio. Right. Those translate easier or say, than sculpting. Yeah. If I want to <span style="color:red" data-ts="289.765" data-end_ts="289.885" title="289.765" id=c_"289.765">__make__</span> a transition to sculpting, that might be a little hard. 'cause I kind of wouldn't know where to start, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Well, actually, you're a LA professional, so the way that you start off being a sculptor is by hiring a sculptor to do your work for you. Right. Yeah. There you go. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Not to leave this room. Okay. Not to leave this room. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's right. <laugh>. So, one of the things, one of the ways that you really caught my attention was your interest in Microtone music. I guess that's the easiest thing to call it. And, some of the experimentation that you personally have done in that area. And, and also you introduced me at that time to the work of Irv Wilson, which has kind of been a secret little fascination of mine ever since I heard about it. But, you're all in, I think you even studied with him a little bit, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah, yeah. I studied with him starting in 89 and then on and off for say, the next 20 years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. What is it, what is is it that's in you that makes Microtonal <span style="color:red" data-ts="360.445" data-end_ts="360.645" title="360.445" id=c_"360.445">__wisdom__</span> speak your voice or speak, speak to your soul, because it's clear when I talk to you, you, you are very passionate about microtonal music. What is it about it that really speaks to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, first of all, I've been, some of us out here have been using a, a different phrase to describe it, rather than microtonal music, using the phrase transcendent tonality. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Because then that includes the normal 12 tone equal scale that everybody else uses. Sure, sure. Okay. And it's basically embracing the full gamut of all possible tuning systems known and unknown in the universe. And so that's what appeals to me, the idea of approaching any kind of new piece of music or, or sound sculpture, from the point of view of embracing all possible tone relationships without prejudice. Sure. Sure. And then saying, okay, which, which one, you know, it's sort of like in, in quantum physics, embracing a quantum field of all possibilities, and then you collapse what they call collapse the wave function to one reality. So if you embrace all possibilities and say, but this is the one I choose right now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you're basically, eliminating all those other ones for that moment, but maintaining the awareness that, that any of these systems are, are viable and usable at any, at any given moment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Sure. So, by sort of transcending any one of 'em, <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.465" data-end_ts="447.685" title="447.465" id=c_"447.465">__it__</span>, it's really more of a mindset that I think is broader than say, in, in, in more of an old school sense. People like Harry Ps, who's probably the most, well-known American, microtonal composer, I think he died in the seventies. But, you know, a guy like him in, in those times had to, had to do all the theory first in a way, and understand what it was that he wanted out of instruments. Then he had to go build them out of wood and metal. Right. And, you know, so you, so you better be damn well sure. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="480.925" data-end_ts="481.125" title="480.925" id=c_"480.925">__like__</span> the scale <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Before you build all that. Then once he built them, he had to learn how to play all of them. And then he had to teach musicians to play them. And, so then you're invested at that point in one tuning system. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="494.345" data-end_ts="494.565" title="494.345" id=c_"494.345">__Now__</span> it turns out his is incredibly viable. And, but he didn't have the freedom in his time to say, well, what would happen if I, you know, change these notes all around? Well, then you'd have to change all of the acoustic instruments. Right. So with, with the electronic music, it's, it's a, it's a wonderful, arena to experiment with, different kinds of tonal relationships, the distances between the notes. The, <span style="color:red" data-ts="522.155" data-end_ts="522.375" title="522.155" id=c_"522.155">__the__</span> another way to describe micro tonality <span style="color:red" data-ts="525.195" data-end_ts="525.415" title="525.195" id=c_"525.195">__is__</span>, is, I like to draw the analogy of a ruler. Like a ruler has 12 inches, so they're equally spaced in a foot if you erase the face of the ruler. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>So it's just blank and start drawing your own inches at different places. You know, say one example would be centimeters, you know? Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="547.415" data-end_ts="547.635" title="547.415" id=c_"547.415">__If__</span> you put 31 centimeters, that's roughly a foot, that's a whole different system of measurement. Sure. So if you place your tones, you know, maybe you only want to use five of them, and they're unequally spaced, you, you end up with different kinds of tonal realities that I believe affect your body differently. And anyone who experiments with, with it just a little bit says, wow, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="570.815" data-end_ts="571.035" title="570.815" id=c_"570.815">__woo__</span>, that scale really feels different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, it's interesting because most people tend to think of like pitch tracking and stuff like that, and in relative terms. Right, right. So that we hear things relative to a starting point and all that stuff, which would tend to make you think, well, if I have a five note scale, how weird could it possibly sound? How disconcerting could it possibly sound? But I certainly know from, from my own playing around with, with, strange scales that they're, some of them are kind of like physically uncomfortable. Yeah. Or some of them are physically very soothing. Right. And it's, it's really, it's really a curiosity 'cause it's sort of like transcends what most people expect, which is that Well, you know, notes Notes is notes. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right. But not <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But not indeed. Let's, let's talk a little bit about your background. One of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking about people's background and how they get to be the <span style="color:red" data-ts="636.115" data-end_ts="636.315" title="636.115" id=c_"636.115">__artists__</span> that they are Composition degree from Stanford sounds like a pretty, <span style="color:red" data-ts="643.315" data-end_ts="643.435" title="643.315" id=c_"643.315">__a__</span> heady, first endpoint. There were obviously some, some ways, you know, waysides along that journey. How did you grow up to be a composition major at Stanford and a film and concert composer, and now a person that is a digital artist? How <span style="color:red" data-ts="666.435" data-end_ts="666.595" title="666.435" id=c_"666.435">__do__</span>, tell me a little bit about the background that sets you up for that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Kind of a, kind of a zigzag pattern, I guess. I started, my first instrument was clarinet. At eight years old. My mother made each of her kids choose an orchestral instrument, and you had no, choice but to study for four years, take lessons, and then you had the right to quit, which I probably did after the four <laugh> because I wanted to play electric guitar. And they wouldn't allow me to do that because they thought I'd get involved with the kids that did drugs, which I did. Anyway, so, there you go. But so what I had to do then was then I got a paper route and saved up money to buy an electric guitar. By the time I was like 14. And then I had, you know, rock bands and, and, and such through junior high and high school, and didn't read a note. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>But because of my mother forcing me to read music, I had, I knew how to do that. So when I got to college, I did not go there to study music. I, like any other 18-year-old, didn't have a clue what I wanted to do. And then my second year there made the mistake of taking a music theory course. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and it grabbed me by the throat because it, it was sort of like that moment in the Wizard of Oz where the dog pulls the curtain back. Right. And you see, oh, it's all being done by a guy behind the curtain. I, it did that to the, to some of the magic and mystery of pop music. It was like, oh my God, these chords go in families, and that's all this is. You know? And then I realized, oh my God, there's not that much to it <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right. So then I, I said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="764.745" data-end_ts="764.965" title="764.745" id=c_"764.745">__oh__</span>, I better change my major 'cause this is going to, it, it put me into an existential crisis. 'cause I realized at that moment, <span style="color:red" data-ts="772.465" data-end_ts="772.685" title="772.465" id=c_"772.465">__any__</span>, anything else I went into, I, I did this little exercise where I said, okay, imagine yourself becoming, say a lawyer. At the end of the day, what are you gonna do? I said, well, I'm gonna go home and play guitar <laugh>. And then I said, well, okay, imagine yourself as a professional guitarist at the end of the day, are you gonna go home and read law books <laugh>? Right. Right. No, it doesn't go the other way. So, right. So what I was, you know, it was a way of, of tuning into what I was trying to tell myself, which was, this is your only option. Go for broke. So, so I, became a music major at that point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And had I not known how to mu to read music, I would not have been able to make, make it. So when I finished, the, the composition program there, i, i, I, at a second existential crisis, which was, do I want to be Jimi Hendrix or do I want to be Igor Stravinsky? In, in those days, those were pretty separate paths. Nowadays, people are doing all kinds of synthesis of, of different things. But, so I kind of kept one foot in each, you know, playing in rock bands and progressive jazz fusion bands and, and then trying to write string quartets and all that kinda stuff. And, learning the, the language of Free Atonality, which I was drawn to at the time, Slosky Ligety Burial, people like that. Sure. And then, my crisis was solved when I took a six week class in film scoring here in la and, the teacher, Albert Harris said, well, you gotta know everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>He says, one week you'll need to write like Revelle. The next week you'll need to write like Duke Ellington. The next week you'll, you know, you might be asked to write something. It's rock oriented. And I said, oh my God. And you get paid for this <laugh> <laugh>. And so, and so, that pretty much solved the crisis. I said, wow, I could get paid to kind of do all of them. The, I I, I also will have to say that the, the, the, the ladder I climbed in my career got burnt in a fire. It, it kind of doesn't exist anymore that, that world of apprenticing with composers and, and, you know, there were, there were opportunities there, you know, in, in breaking into, as a film composer in the late seventies, early eighties, you had to know how to conduct and to orchestrate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right. So that checked a lot of people at the door, you know, said there might be a few hundred people trying to break into as opposed to a hundred thousand, you know? Right. So, so I, I did that for a long time keeping, so I, I started out writing, music for cartoons as a ghost writer for a company called Ruby <span style="color:red" data-ts="938.545" data-end_ts="938.765" title="938.545" id=c_"938.545">__and__</span> Spears, and also for Hanna Barbera doing Popeye and things like that. Then in the early eighties, I got a break as a ghost writer for Mike Post, and Pete Carpenter, who at the time had six to eight different TV series and needed to hire, a staff of composers to help them just deliver, make their deadlines each week. Right. And it was a great time to do that because every TV show at that point, TV show and movies had to have an orchestra. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>It was before there were sequencers, before there was even, you know, VHS you know, because you, you would have to go look at the picture in the editing room and then remember the scene when you went home and, and wrote for it on the piano, because that's all you had, you know? Right, right. And then write out everything in pencil. And, and so for the longest time, I made my living with a pencil. And so over all that time, you know, fast forward to today where every, everything is computerized, and, and you don't need a pencil at all. So, so the way that that evolved though, so through all through the eighties, I was writing chase music for cop shows, basically. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and at the same time, in spare time doing all this dissonant, atonal, contemporary classical stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>What led me to my third existential crisis was after doing a bunch of it, I would, you know, if, if I was lucky enough to hear any of it. 'cause it was always hard to get things played. 'cause those kind of, that kind of music is very hard and demands rehearsal time. And, and so whenever I would hear something, I would kind of like it <laugh>, but not really. Right. You know, it was just so abstract and dissonant, and it was hard to make things really ballsy, <laugh>, in that language. But I got fluent in that, in that sort of free atonality quasi serial type language, and, decided, ah, I kind of don't want to do this. And I, I didn't see it really going anywhere. Okay. And the other trend in classical music at the time was minimalism, which I didn't like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>'cause I felt it lacked drums and bass <laugh>. You know, why, you know, it's like, why even bother doing that? Just make it pop music and, you know, and, and, and go to the rig. So, so, so that kind of, kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1082.405" data-end_ts="1082.445" title="1082.405" id=c_"1082.405">__of__</span> wandered the desert creatively for a few years because I couldn't figure out, gee, I'm not gonna warm the water writing this atonal dissonance stuff, because there are people who do that already really well, and I'm not sure I wanna be one of 'em, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I don't wanna go the minimal route. So I didn't feel I had a home in terms of my actual real musical identity of my musical soul. Sure. And then when I met Irv Wilson, it was like, you mean I can get my triads back without having to go to the 19th century to get them <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1115.945" data-end_ts="1116.165" title="1115.945" id=c_"1115.945">__you__</span>, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>'cause I didn't wanna have to go back to older harmonic language. Right, right. That wasn't an option either, you know? 'cause that's already been done and written really well by pretty much everyone who's come before us, you know? Right. So, so this was like, wow, this is a whole nother universe. And so that fucked my head up, and it's still, it's still pretty messed up <laugh> as a result of that, because that it was kind of getting exposed to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1143.985" data-end_ts="1144.205" title="1143.985" id=c_"1143.985">__the__</span> a a a sort of breadth of possibilities that still floors me, how, how wide that, that realm is and the different things you can do with it. And so that's has led me today. So whenever I begin a project now, I always begin with the idea that I'm gonna use whatever note combinations are, are best for whatever I wanna do creatively, and then have to give myself a reason. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Like why not to, for example, if it's a project about a country western musician and they want music that sounds authentic. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's not a microtonal project. I'm sorry. Right, right. You better stick with exactly what that is. But then there are other opportunities. Like I have a movie that's gonna come out this year, a national, release <span style="color:red" data-ts="1191.645" data-end_ts="1191.765" title="1191.645" id=c_"1191.645">__a__</span> Miramax picture called South Side with you. And it's a, it's a love story about Barack and Michelle Obama's first date. And, so you would think, well, how would you score that, you know, late eighties Chicago? Well, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1207.085" data-end_ts="1207.285" title="1207.085" id=c_"1207.085">__used__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1207.325" data-end_ts="1207.445" title="1207.325" id=c_"1207.325">__a__</span> 31 tone scale through most of it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because the major triads in a 31 tone scale are perfectly in tune. They don't beat. So when you have these moments of quiet between two people who are falling in love, hitting these beautifully in tuned chords really affect you physically in a, in a way that, and, and, and the, the score is very simple that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's, it's just a lot of major chords, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1232.725" data-end_ts="1232.925" title="1232.725" id=c_"1232.725">__the__</span>, they're not the major chords of your grandfather. They're right. They're really in tune. The thirds are flat and, and they don't beat. So you, you have a, I had special guitars made, to be able to, that have 31 frets perve, and then I tuned all the senses to, to be in the key that, that I tuned it to. Right, right. And, and so you wouldn't necessarily think, you know, coming into a project like that, oh, this could, this could be microtonal. But when I hit that first chord for the director, Richard Tan, he said, that's it. Whatever that is, I want that <laugh> Interesting. And, and so, and so the, it's kind of this more broad perspective is sort of opening up. I mean, Paul Simon's new album, he, he's got a song on it where he actually went to Princeton and used some of the old Harry Parks instruments. I'm dying to hear what he did with him. And I think Beck also has one, he wrote a song about Harry Parch. So, so the, the, pop pop world is starting to open up to this too, in the, in the mainstream. Right. And I think it will go in a very interesting direction, because when you think really about where can music go, that's one of the few areas that it really can grow for a long time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That is really pretty fascinating stuff. I'm, now, I'm curious about a lot of things related to that. And first of all, for people who aren't familiar with Irv Wilson's work, can you give us like a three or four minute overview of what that's, that's about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah, that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know that's kind of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1328.125" data-end_ts="1328.205" title="1328.125" id=c_"1328.125">__test__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Kind of like trying, trying to take the Pacific Ocean and put it in a cup. But I think the best description of him is a musical or harmonic cartographer, kind of a map maker. Someone who's charted, you know, large swaths of territory, much of which is unexplored. And he, he did so through the use of, some pretty simple math that would sort of open up, these, how would you say it? He, he creates these entities in a way. They're, they're, they're little mathematical entities that create scales. So it's a sys, he has systems that create subsystems of tunings. So unlike Harry Parks, who, who invented a, a new mousetrap, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1377.025" data-end_ts="1377.675" title="1377.025" id=c_"1377.025">__Eric Wilson__</span> examined mouse trap ness, <laugh> and <laugh>. And then once you embrace that, you're able to then create thousands of new scales yourself. One of the guys who studied with the Marcus Hobbes wrote this incredible app that he continues to improve on called Will <span style="color:red" data-ts="1396.725" data-end_ts="1397.075" title="1396.725" id=c_"1396.725">__Sonic__</span>. It's a, it's an iPad app. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Believe me, I got it. The second that it came out. It, it's amazing. Did you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. <laugh>. Well, there you go. See, that's pretty much all the beginner needs to at least get their, start getting their head and hands around the vastness of the, of the territory. And, you know, you could take a, you know, a, a pentatonic scale and then change the, the, the size of the steps in between and, and get all of these different, possibilities. Then when you find one you like, you can, export it as a scale file, and then your sense can be tuned to that, and you can get access to all of the, all of your patches. Right. So I have a YouTube video that is a really sped up two minute version of kind of how that works. And it shows a little composition being written in, written in Omnisphere Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> again, with the Wilson app, you know, just exploring, finding a scale you like, export it, and off you go. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things that I certainly found, fascinating about Wilson's, the cartography methods that he uses or, or your, your concept of sort of like the mouse trap, the essence of mouse traps, mouse trap ness, is that so much of it has like this geometric nature to it, or almost like a 3D geometry. And when you see it, it, it not only has like this musical connection to frequencies, but there's this sort of like innate beauty in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1492.735" data-end_ts="1493.085" title="1492.735" id=c_"1492.735">__delay__</span> of the thing, just in graphical terms. So in your time spent with and around him, I mean, was there, did you get a sense that that beauty was part of what drew him into doing this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Without a, without a question. He has a remarkable ability to visualize things in three dimension. Apparently when he was in the Air Force in the forties, they gave him some sort of aptitude test having to do with spatial visualization. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And they say he had, he scored the highest of anyone in history before that <laugh>. Wow. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1528.915" data-end_ts="1529.135" title="1528.915" id=c_"1528.915">__he__</span>, and so what, essentially what Irv does is he hears these tonal relationships, and then he maps 'em to polyhedra to, to three dimensional objects. So when you went over his house, they'd be, they'd be filled with these complex three dimensional objects that he had built out of sticks and styrofoam balls, <laugh>. And, and whenever you would ask him a question, he'd pull one out <laugh>. And, and, and essentially what Marcus tried to do with the Wilson app is to squash that down into two dimensions so that you could do something Irv couldn't do, which was when you touch one of those styrofoam connectors to actually hear it, to hear the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1569.915" data-end_ts="1570.135" title="1569.915" id=c_"1569.915">__so__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1570.205" data-end_ts="1570.495" title="1570.205" id=c_"1570.205">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>But the, the cool thing about it is that the, any of those, those notes are usually extrapolated from a minimal set of, of, of relationships, like say the relationship of four to seven to nine to 11. Right. And then you extrapolate all the multiples of that. So there's nothing magic about those numbers. You can change it to five, to six to eight to nine or something, you know, you can change the variables. That's a new concept. The idea that that, that you are embracing variables in the creation of a scale. But the, but the relationships in, as they're mapped at that three dimensional object, stay the same. So that say every, every, if you imagine, say like a, a pyramid shape, you know, the, the, the top of it would be OneNote and the, you know, the four bases would be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1623.075" data-end_ts="1623.365" title="1623.075" id=c_"1623.075">__four__</span>, you know, four other nodes. Right. The relationship of that angle from one of the one points on the ground to the center, will always say, be a perfect fifth or, or, or, or a major third or whatever you determine. So as you add more complex installations of that object, those angle of the relationship, anything parallel to that will always have the same, interval. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Sure. Based on what your starting values were. So that, that's the thing, it's a little bit hard, I think, initially to, to get your head around the, the, the sort of Wilson universe, which is it's variables. It's not fixed values until you decide that they're gonna be fixed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You decide at some point to some frequency to lock 'em into. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Bam. Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in, in practical terms, in working with these kind of, these kind of unique scales or tuning systems or whatever, I mean, you mentioned already having to, you know, have, special guitars constructed or, you know, if you, if you pour scallop files into a soft synth, it'll do your scale, but actually finding a surface that matches that is gonna be a tough sled. And it seems to me, you know, in the case of guitar, you have to, you have to change your technique in the case of a keyboard, you have to actually change the nature of the instrument, don't you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. It kind of depends on what you're playing around with. If you're playing around with alternate ways of tuning 12 notes Yeah. They'll map great onto the keyboard. You already know. Sure. Or less if it's, you know, say five notes or six notes per ve you know, you just finger chromatically, uhhuh <affirmative>, and you can get around. But when you start getting into like 31, like what I have, then that's two octaves and a half. Right. For, for on a keyboard to here, one octave. So, you know, an 88 key keyboard will only give you not even three octaves. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. So that gets a little, cumbersome and you end up doing a lot of step loading. Yeah. Okay. But I, but that's why Irv in invented this, and designed this alternate keyboard that, that was produced for a few years by Star Labs called the Wilson Micro Zone. The one I have is, 908, 810 keys. My God. And they're all hexagonal <laugh>, and, and they're generalized. And so it's quite a, it's, it's quite a, a, a, a beast to, to ride, but Right, right. Actually, I think if, if you started a five-year-old who had never seen a piano, I think they would figure out the big one, the, the hexagonal one easier. Right. Because it's generalized. One of the things about the piano that I, I just doesn't make any sense to me, is that, you know, you play a, a major chord in the key of C it's all white keys. You, you play it in dfl, it's two blacks, one white. Right. The key of D it's two whites, one, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1807.325" data-end_ts="1807.525" title="1807.325" id=c_"1807.325">__but__</span>, you know, there's 12 different shapes that your hands have to remember it, but it's the same chord. Right. On a general keyboard like the Wilson nine 90, you know, once you've got the shape of a chord, major, minor, whatever, anywhere you slide that, it'll be the same shape. So, you know, any kind of modulation doesn't involve having to learn a new fingering. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. How, how available were these keyboards? 'cause I've actually seen the picture of you with, with this thing, which is sort of like, it looks slightly smaller than a football field, you know, covered with little hexagonal buttons. I mean, were, did, were there a fair number of 'em made or were they pretty hard to come by? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>They were kind of hard to come by. You had to kind of, he, he would make them per order. Oh, I see. Okay. And, it was a, it was not a moneymaking proposition. Right. So eventually he just couldn't make them anymore. And they're no longer available. Jeff, Snyder, yeah. Made one called the Manta, which is, also hexagonal incredibly cool instrument. It's only 48 keys. It's for Max. So you have to have max in the mix. And it's a, a little bit hard to set up once you get it set up. That thing is phenomenal. And then there are apps now, iPad apps I think that have hexagons, but again, there's nothing really super simple out there. There are a few other hexagonal keyboards that other people have made, physical ones. You know, the problem is there's no one, when you open up this broader universe, you when you get into a physical interface to access it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. Like a keyboard, there's no one that's absolutely perfect. Right. So the more flexible, the nice thing about the Wilson nine 90 was, you know, each key was programmable to its own midi note number and channel. Right. So you could come up with, and, and we had software written for it that would show you the best fingerings for whatever scale you had. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, ones that were like, you could make a a 31 tone scale really compact if you wanted to, play chords and keep 'em within the reach of an of your hand. Right. But if you wanted to play rapid chromatic stuff, you could extrapolate a different kind of, of design where the keys were really spread out so you could play rapid chromatic licks, you know, with just two fingers. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, that's actually interesting. 'cause you know, when you were talking about spreading out a 31 to scale across the standard keyboard, all of a sudden the concept of triads gets to be a physical stressor because you're gonna have trouble stretching your <span style="color:red" data-ts="1977.445" data-end_ts="1977.605" title="1977.445" id=c_"1977.445">__hand__</span>. It's a large, far enough to be able to pull off even a simple, simple triad. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1984.935" data-end_ts="1985.155" title="1984.935" id=c_"1984.935">__But__</span> what, what Irv has on the, hexagonal keyboard is absolutely wonderful because the Octa fits beautifully within, your hand, the range of your hand. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, the major triads are where you would expect them. So the way it's, the way the thing is laid out, it's nice and compact. You just kind of turn a little bit to the side and you get all these notes in between. So between C and D, you might have four other notes instead of just one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>But if you only wanna play the 12, the subset of 12 out of 31, that, that's why it's such a good scale, that subset of 12 is very close to our 12 equal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>A lot of people could be fooled by it. Interesting. The major scale within it, the minor, and that's the beauty of it. Because as soon as you want to get freaky, it's like, whoa, where did all these other notes coming? <laugh>? Well, they, they're in the family, they're cousins <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>They're actually mathematically related. But if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2039.955" data-end_ts="2040.195" title="2039.955" id=c_"2039.955">__wanna__</span> play just regular, you know, b flat to, you know, to G minor, to e-flat to f you can do all that. Right. 'cause that subset of 12 is very, very close to what we're used to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. But at this point, nobody is making a large format surface that that'll handle this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Not that I know of. And that's where it gets kind of interesting because, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2064.935" data-end_ts="2065.155" title="2064.935" id=c_"2064.935">__and__</span>, and that's why my preoccupation with physical instruments, I mean, that's what I came up on. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2069.235" data-end_ts="2069.515" title="2069.235" id=c_"2069.235">__Yeah__</span>. Right. And, yes, a lot of microtonal do everything in the box. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is, which is cool. It's cool the fact that you can even do that. But as soon as you want to get something in the real world, which is where I think a lot of the magic and nuance comes from. You gotta <span style="color:red" data-ts="2087.035" data-end_ts="2087.235" title="2087.035" id=c_"2087.035">__reread__</span> guitars or you gotta saw pipes <laugh>, right. To the, you know, or, or saw marimba bars. And then, and then you're only able to lock into that one, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The one thing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Rendering, you know? So yeah, the, the closest thing was the, the Microsoft. But for somebody else to, to do that. Wow. It's, you know, I was one of the people that kind of helped sort of produce that, or finance that was on the development team with Star. We hired Harvey Star, Irv Wilson, Gary, David and I, to actually build the thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, seeing what everything he went through. Oh my God. <laugh>. I wouldn't wish that, I wouldn't wish that on anybody. <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Hear you. But, but maybe with technology now, LEDs or something, there would be a way to do it more simply. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Maybe So, it seems, it seems curious and, and the, the fact of the matter is, I think also there's a little bit of change in people's heads coming from things like what Ableton did with their scale layouts on the push. All of a sudden people got used to the idea that, Hey, when you have this arrangement across pads that has a musical nature to it, shapes become an important part of playing certain kinds of riffage. Right. And yeah. And I've seen people who were very comfortable playing on regular keyboards all of a sudden take on a very different playing persona when using shapes becomes a part of a playing style. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>You know, that's really an interesting point because certainly within this realm, you know, there are different ways of discovering stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you can discover something with your ear. You can discover things with your hand, like what you're talking about with shapes. Right. Or with your eyes, like, wow, what happens if I hit this one and that one and then reach over and get those, and then come down one up, one down one up one <laugh>. You know, you make up these patterns that are visual and sometimes you say, I like the way that sounds. Yeah. So your eyes can find it, your ears can find it, or your brain can find it through math. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right. You can say, well, what would happen if I multiplied each of these by three, then subtracted one multiplied by three again, you know? Yeah. Yeah. It's the same thing. You're, you're riffing with numbers or you're riffing with your hands, or you're riffing with your ears or your eyes. So there's like these four ways of discovering stuff. Shapes is really everything. I think what's going to be interesting, and, and something that worries me a little bit is because it's so vast, it's really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2243.905" data-end_ts="2244.125" title="2243.905" id=c_"2243.905">__ha__</span> hard, it's almost impossible that it would evolve in any one direction. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>I mean, when you, when you think about the piano, you know, as imperfect as it is as an interface, all of the literature has been a result of the way those key keys are laid out. Yeah. You know, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2260.565" data-end_ts="2260.685" title="2260.565" id=c_"2260.565">__I__</span> look, think of a Ray Charles lick, you know, where it kind of slides off a black <span style="color:red" data-ts="2263.605" data-end_ts="2263.765" title="2263.605" id=c_"2263.605">__key__</span> onto a white key. You can only do that on the piano. Right. And, and it's because of the way the piano's laid out that those licks were those really cool licks were born. So the exciting thing about having a different interface is you find new ones. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But the downside, it seems like two of the downsides, one that I rant on constantly, which is that if there's a new interface every other week, how does anyone get to be a virtuoso at any of it? And then secondly, if there's a new interface every week or two, how does a pedagogy ever get built for that interface? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. I'm disturbed by those same questions. Yeah. Have been for a while and have not come up with what I think is a good answer, because there may not be one <laugh>. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2313.765" data-end_ts="2313.885" title="2313.765" id=c_"2313.765">__There__</span> may not be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2314.405" data-end_ts="2314.445" title="2314.405" id=c_"2314.405">__one__</span>. You're right. You've really nailed it there, you know, and it's like, shit. Yeah. So we opened up all this with all of our all, you know, things like Max and things like Ableton Live, and there's all these new possibilities. But look at the problem there is even now, without even considering the scale <span style="color:red" data-ts="2332.235" data-end_ts="2332.525" title="2332.235" id=c_"2332.235">__from__</span> tuning world of, of, interfacing with another musician's stuff, you know, everyone's got their own little favorite plugins and this, that, and the other, collaborating with somebody is not just like, Hey, bring your guitar over and we'll write something. Right. You know, it's sort of like, okay, well do you have that plugin? Well, how'd you get that sound? Because I don't have that <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, no, it's interesting because you are one of the people that I think of as really embracing the physical instrument and, and some of what you've done. I, I heard a piece that you did on a fretless guitar, which was just wonderful. And it wasn't necessarily hyper technique <span style="color:red" data-ts="2379.885" data-end_ts="2380.245" title="2379.885" id=c_"2379.885">__filled__</span>. Yeah. But it was just beautiful and expressive and the way that you played it seemed like it would've been impossible to do in the box. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How much of, how much of your current work do you think is related to the fact that you're willing to do stuff out of the box in real, using real world tools and real world interfaces? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>A a lot of it, and I think that's part of the trick, is trying to keep one foot in the analog world and one in the digital. Because ultimately everything ends up in the digital world. But to me, a lot of the magic and the nuance, we do not wanna throw the baby out with the bath water. So, things you can do on a guitar or any kind of acoustic interface, the amount of programming it takes to imitate that is not worth it, I don't think. 'cause it's never quite right. Yeah. And, unless you make it a thing in and of itself, like, okay, I'm going to, I'm gonna make this electronic sound be the thing, you know. Sure. But, but I find myself all the time reaching more for, acoustic stuff to the point where I've even got a new instrument I had built here about a year ago that's also I'm using now in everything. I, I call it the transcendence. A friend of mine who's a violin maker, David Reus, made this thing for me, and it's a cross between a pedal steel and a, and a cello. It has pedals that will bend the individual strings while you bow it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And what I found was, 'cause I've always wish I could play a, a string instrument, like a, like a, you know, violin, viola, or cello. Right. But it just takes too damn long to get good at it. Right. And so with this thing, it took me about a year, and this last project I did, that's a PBS documentary on Maya <span style="color:red" data-ts="2498.045" data-end_ts="2498.365" title="2498.045" id=c_"2498.045">__Angel__</span> that's going to air this summer as part of the PBS Masterworks series. I, I did some stuff with the live, with the string quartet, playing along with it. And I actually blended in and, and they turned around like, holy shit, you know, <laugh>. And what was really fun, Darwin was each of 'em came up and tried to play it with their bows. Right. And they couldn't, they sounded terrible <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>But, but I, you know, the, I I had a solo I I did in unison with the cellist, and he said, wow. He says, your phrasing is better than a lot of the people that play in my sections. Because I was able to just study and listen to how string players, phrase and then use this, this sort of new instrument. The, the nice thing about it is I, I put underneath the strings 'cause there's a big distance between the string and the, and the actual, what would be a fretboard, there's no fret, but I, I have these printouts that I put under that are, okay, here's the 12 equal printout. So I'm able to cheat basically, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2559.445" data-end_ts="2559.645" title="2559.445" id=c_"2559.445">__and__</span> <laugh> like a pedal steel player would. Right, right. Right. He doesn't actually down on the string Right. And touch a fret, but he glides over it and he has a guide so he knows when he is reaching up an octave, there's my octave. Right, right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>So it's like a pedal seal that way. But the cool thing is, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2573.925" data-end_ts="2574.125" title="2573.925" id=c_"2573.925">__can__</span> peel that template off and put a 31 tone template and very quickly go from step one of a 31 tone scale to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2581.765" data-end_ts="2582.005" title="2581.765" id=c_"2581.765">__step__</span> 26. And nobody can do that. Right. I mean, a string player, can't they, they, they couldn't hear that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Couldn't hear it or, or nail it. And the problem is, I would assume with like these high note scales, nailing the exact pitch is really critical because the, the tuning is probably a little bit more sensitive than 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Equal temperament tuning. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right, right. You want to get it right. You can be outta tune in those systems too. Yeah. Yeah. So, so being able to look at this little cheat sheet underneath the string is great, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2618.165" data-end_ts="2618.205" title="2618.165" id=c_"2618.165">__<laugh>__</span> because nobody can see it but me. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And say, yeah, I'm gonna go from this note to that one, back down to that one. And then you can program your sense after that to double it. And then you say, wow, that was not an accident. All of those instruments are hitting that exact same pitch together. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2636.005" data-end_ts="2636.165" title="2636.005" id=c_"2636.005">__flavor__</span> intensive. But to me, the payoff is like, to me that's the path forward is having just a handful of acoustic instruments that can add that kind of realism. Sure. And that's why I'm saying I'm very curious how Paul Simon used it in in his new album. Right. That's supposed to come out, I think, next month. Thanks. Yeah. I think the song is called Insomniacs Lullaby or something like that. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious then, so you talk about getting this new instrument built and spending a year kind of getting some facility or, you know, skill with it. What does, what does your work day or your work life look like? Because it seems like, given the things that you're exploring, you have to dedicate a certain amount of time to research. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2684.625" data-end_ts="2684.845" title="2684.625" id=c_"2684.625">__Yep__</span>. You have to dedicate a certain amount of time to skill building as well as pumping out tracks for an animation or doing spotting for your next film work. How, how do you fit all of that into a working day?

<b>Stephen: </b>I have no downtime basically, other than when things break, which is often uhhuh <affirmative>. But no, I, I don't, I mean, I call it lab work and there's always a long list of things like, oh, I want to try using an Ebo on this thing, or I want to try, I want to try using that delay plugin with this, you know. And so, you kind of do that and you make little notes to yourself like, okay, that would be good. But usually a a a particular need will arise that will prompt me to have to do that. Sure. And then once I do it, it's usually project related. So I try to roll in some of the lab work to the actual work itself. But it's, it's a little, it's a little unwieldy. I, I will have to say <laugh> and, and it, it drives me crazy and I'm, I'm glad I have a studio that's outside the home because I would, I, I can close the door at night. When I used to work out of my basement, I never was home even though I was home. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Because this, this stuff will, will take as much as you can give it and more. So it's very, very hard to, I think if you embrace this path to, to also have a balanced home life. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2774.445" data-end_ts="2774.565" title="2774.445" id=c_"2774.445">__I__</span>, I work really hard at work really hard at that. I know you're good at it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, I'm not. I'm terrible at it. I work all the time. And my, my, my wife and children, when they, when they imagine me, they imagine the back of my head staring into a screen 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b><laugh>. Oh boy. Well, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Not, not, I'm not good at the balance <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>But you, but you, you understand what I'm saying, how hard it is because it's a, it's a rabbit hole. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is, it is. And, and it's endlessly fascinating. I mean, what, what you're talking about, and, and this is why I love talking to you, is I, it, it resonates with me. This sense of having a career that is as much of a voyage as it is a set of projects is really kind of interesting. But it's also, it is a little overwhelming because you can give it every bit of time that you have and then some, and it, it will overwhelm all of that time and every part of, it'll be fascinating, but it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2838.085" data-end_ts="2838.205" title="2838.085" id=c_"2838.085">__just__</span>, it's, I I watch my son when he plays like a, a really absorbing video game. And I don't really get into video games in that way, but I see how what I do is a different version of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. You're, you're just not a first person shooter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Exactly. Alright, well, anyway, it seems like you're, you are on and you continue to be on some pretty fascinating journeys. Now. I'm, I'm curious, given that your journey includes things like developing scales and developing new instruments and stuff like that, what, but also that you're kind of expanding into this idea of being a content provider rather than simply a composer. What, how do you imagine the next bits of instrumentation that you do? I mean, can you imagine things that are as useful to your writing or as useful to your graphic work as a new instrument is in your, into your music? Do you imagine things that are aids in those areas as well? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. Although I'd have to say I don't quite have the same kind of, background on the visual elements to say, Hey, what I need here is a new plugin, you know? Right. Or, or what I need here is a new paint or a new way to render color. Again, that's one of the things I'm drawn to with Max, but of course, max is another rabbit hole. <laugh> in and of itself, as they found out very quickly, <laugh> Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>That, I'm in awe of the people that know all of it. You know, the jitter in the sound design and the acoustics and the midi and the, you know, and the graphics and, and geometry and, and being able to rotate things and hear what they sound like. So that, that alone is a, is a, but, but that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2955.725" data-end_ts="2955.885" title="2955.725" id=c_"2955.725">__where__</span>, where I'm drawn to. 'cause at least that way, if I, if I do come up against a particular need that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2963.305" data-end_ts="2963.525" title="2963.305" id=c_"2963.305">__how__</span>, how do you say it? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2964.285" data-end_ts="2964.365" title="2964.285" id=c_"2964.285">__Ra__</span> Ray and Charles Eames, the famous, designer, said, innovate only as a last resort. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And so if there's something off the shelf you can grab, great. But that's what's happened with some of these instruments where it's like, yeah, I'm gonna have to innovate here because I'm, I'm feeling a need for something that is not off the shelf. Right. And if there, if there's a quicker way to get there, then let's build something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Do you have any, do you have any instruments you're dying to build or are in the middle of building right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Not, not at the present. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2994.915" data-end_ts="2995.205" title="2994.915" id=c_"2994.915">__Okay__</span>. Because this, this transcendo has been such a project, I still need to drive it up to the, to, to my friend who made it in, in Oregon. He, he has to make a, a bunch of, final mods on it. Okay. That, that I think will finally lock this thing in. But I put so much, you know, it's, it's one of those things. There's a, there's a, how would you say it, you know, having all these instruments is like having a harem, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Which may, may not be as glorious as it sounds <span style="color:red" data-ts="3022.315" data-end_ts="3022.805" title="3022.315" id=c_"3022.315">__because__</span> you can remember all their birthdays, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right. There's a lot of maintenance involved. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>There's a lot of maintenance involved. And, and also a lot of skill in learning how to, how to make each one speak. So there's a tendency to kind of acquire more and more, as my wife will attest to, you know, and say, why do you need another instrument? Well, well, this one does this, you know, and, and, the other ones don't. But at some point you have to say, okay, well how much time am I gonna spend with each of these 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>To really, really be able to do something convincing on them? So I'm gonna stage right now where I kind of want to just chill for a minute and try to get a little bit better on these things. Sure. So, you know, so I'm, I'm always kind of tinkering around with stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="3068.885" data-end_ts="3069.085" title="3068.885" id=c_"3068.885">__to__</span> just try to figure out a new way into this <span style="color:red" data-ts="3072.065" data-end_ts="3072.285" title="3072.065" id=c_"3072.065">__and__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3072.305" data-end_ts="3072.525" title="3072.305" id=c_"3072.305">__and__</span> ways to solve, sonic problems that arise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Steven, I want to thank you so much for the time that you dedicated to talking to me and, sharing your experiences and your ideas, as always fascinating spending time with you. And, I just hope that things continue to go as well for you as they seem to have <span style="color:red" data-ts="3096.365" data-end_ts="3096.645" title="3096.365" id=c_"3096.365">__been__</span>. Thanks a lot for your time and, and have a great day. Thanks, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Darwin Always, always very stimulating talking to you, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Alright man. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Steven for the time, for the opportunity to talk about microtonal <span style="color:red" data-ts="3113.565" data-end_ts="3113.725" title="3113.565" id=c_"3113.565">__wisdom__</span>, which is always really interesting subject. It's one that's kind of hard to always embrace, but man, once you get into it seems to have a lot of fun. Everybody I know that gets into it, gets into it big time ride. Beyond that, I want to just thank you for continuing to listen, continue to listen more. I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="3132.365" data-end_ts="3132.525" title="3132.365" id=c_"3132.365">__going__</span> to got a couple more here in the pocket before we head off to, Minnesota. And then you'll probably hear the tone of my voice change because something I'm sure will change. It'll be awesome. Otherwise, I will talk to you next week.
